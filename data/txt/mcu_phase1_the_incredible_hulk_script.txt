BLACK: THE SOUND OF COLD WIND
EXT. DECK OF AN ICE-BREAKING TUG BOAT - ARCTIC SEA - DAY
A battered old rescue tug churns north through broken pack ice.
A MAN stands in the prow staring at the world of ice. A wasteland.
He signals up to CAPTAIN. The boat slows to a halt. The man
shoulders a small pack. He climbs over onto a ladder and descends
onto the frozen edge of the pack ice. He turns his back on the
boat and starts walking toward the distant shore.
The CAPTAIN stares at the receding figure, expressionless. He
pushes the throttle forward and the boat moves on.
EXT. GLACIER EDGE - DAY
Small in the frame the man trudges resolute toward nothing. The
wind starting to whip up.
He climbs through the maze of ice and rock to reach the plateau of
the glacier. He stops and shrugs off the pack, roots around and
takes something out, we can't see what. He unzips the parka and
puts the object in his waist and zips up and sets off again.
Incomprehensibly he leaves the pack behind.
EXT. PLATEAU OF THE GLACIER - DAY
The man has been walking a long time. He stops and looks around.
Ice. Mountains behind. The green-black of the sea out in front.
Not a human sign, no life at all. Except...
AN ARCTIC FOX, buried almost invisible, watching.
The man looks up at THE AURORA BOREALIS - eerie dancing sheets of
green and purple flowing across the sky.
Tighter on THE MAN’S FACE:

looking up…hollowed out, haunted.

MEMORY FLASH:
A banshee shriek of sound. An image streaked liked a camera moved
on a slow shutter. A WOMAN’S BODY on the ground, FLAMES…but we
probably can't make it out.
EXT. GLACIER - DAY
THE MAN’S EYES: wide open. Anguish.

2.

He takes off the parka and throws it away from him and it is taken
by the wind. He falls to his knees, much too exposed now. He
stares forward at nothing, gathering his will.
And now we see the GUN in his waistband. His hand takes it and
points it down and into the snow but he stares ahead.
His thumb PULLS THE HAMMER BACK and the heartbeat starts to race.
From behind and to the side a bit: THE DULL PULSE OF A GREENISH
GLOW IN THE BASE OF HIS SKULL, beneath the edge of his cap.
EYES: flaring wide snapping from blue to DEEP GLOWING GREEN.
From behind him again: the hand with the gun JERKS UP THE FOX in the snow: a FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT on the white snow and
a muffled report of a GUNSHOT and the fox is gone...
From a distance: the man, hard to make out the figure from this
far away, hard to get a sense of scale… still on the knees, head
bent, falling forward now but HIS ARM SHOOTS OUT TO CATCH HIM.
THE ARM: close on the forearm as it hits the snow, hand
outstretched. HUGE. MUSCLED. GREEN.
A clicking sound…metal on teeth…the hand rises toward the face out
of frame and the clicking stops. The hand lowers, open. A
MASSIVE FLAT PALM WITH A BULLET IN IT. Smashed completely flat.
A long beat with nothing but cold wind.
EXT. GLACIER SHELF - DAY
Wide: the cliff edge of the whole glacier shelf seen from out in
the water looking back.
In the wind: A SOUND. Was that a distant ROAR? A HOWL?
took it away... and then...
BOOM:

The wind

a huge dull reverberation echoing

And with it a HUGE PIECE OF THE GLACIER the size of an aircraft
carrier cleaves off the shelf and tumbles roaring into the sea.
A WAVE, the enormous tsunami ripple from the ice pounding into the
water… we're at water level and it's coming toward us like a
freight train and over us and we're…
EXT. UNDERWATER - ARCTIC SEA - DAY
Inky green black of the frozen sea but exploding into frame from
above, massive chunks of greenish, white ice.

3.
Plunging down into the black, trailing bubbles that fade… and out
of their ghostly greenish traces in the black:
TITLES: THE INCREDIBLE HULK
FADE UP:
TITLE: FIVE YEARS LATER - PORTO VERDE, BRAZIL
EXT. HILLS ABOVE A FAVELA SLUM - MORNING
BRUCE BANNER is running. Up in the hills, past the fringes of the
favela, he descends toward the chaos of houses and streets of the
city, sprawled like a living organism, teeming with people.
He slows to check something on his wrist: A PULSE MONITOR
It shows: 90

Low for somebody running hard.

EXT. FAVELA STREET - MORNING
Banner walking now, anonymous in the teeming streets. Nondescript.
EXT. STREET MARKET - DAY
Banner stops at a market stall and picks up a package. He opens it
and takes out a BOOK. If we see it we will see that it is a book
of rare South American FLOWERS.
EXT. SHOPFRONT - STREET MARKET - DAY
Banner greets a SHOP-OWNER he’s friendly with. The man has a
COMPUTER that he lets Banner use sometimes. BANNER gets online
and sends a quick MESSAGE:
“Mr. Blue: Received your package. Still looking for my flower. Mr
Green.”
EXT. MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO - DAY
BANNER enters a low building, a knapsack slung over his shoulder.
INT. AIKIDO STUDIO - DAY
Banner and an INSTRUCTOR train by themselves. Banner practices
deflecting aggressive energy and attacks without losing his
composure. Just as his instructor seems to be complimenting him
on a move and Banner relaxes, the instructor SLAPS him, hard.

4.
It surprises him and his PULSE beeps up a bit…over 80. But he
stays calm and nods, it's a test they practice. The instructor
nods and then SLAPS HIM HARDER and SHOVES him… PULSE pegs up near
100, Banner holds out a hand “Stop”. He takes a deep breath and
calms himself. The instructor's fingernail has scratched his
cheek. A DROP OF BLOOD oozing... He feels it and immediately dabs
it with a cloth from his bag. Then he pulls out a tube of CRAZY
GLUE and applies a little to the cut carefully. Puts the cloth in
his bag.
EXT. BOTTLING PLANT - MORNING - (DAYS LATER)
The massive ungainly bulk of a Third World factory. BANNER enters
it with a line of Brazilian laborers. Time has passed, he’s been
working and biding his time.
INT. BOTTLING PLANT - CHANGING ROOM - DAY
The rough locker room of the male workers. Dirty walls, old
cracked floors naked bulb. Men pulling gloves and goggles out of
lockers, changing shirts. BANNER is among them.
FOUR YOUNG TOUGH GUYS are the most boisterous, one shoving the
other playfully, BUMPING BANNER slightly. They don’t apologize
but it doesn’t matter because he literally doesn’t even react.
INT. BOTTLING PLANT - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY
An enormous sprawling forest of machinery, steam pipes, conveyor
belts...all in a huge open floor with a high tin-roof ceiling. A
catwalk runs around the perimeter up above and across to the tops
of certain of the biggest machines.
BANNER works in the soda bottling plant. His job is rudimentary,
carrying supplies of bottle caps or bottles to the workers who man
the massive conveyor belts of bottles moving through the process:
GUARANA SODA flowing in from massive tanks, caps being sealed on,
labels being applied:
“AMAZONA - with Guarana Kick!”
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN smiles at BANNER as he delivers to her and he
smiles back but keeps moving, distant.
EXT. BOTTLING PLANT - DELIVERY BAYS - DAY
Break time. Seen from a distance, BANNER is by the TRUCK DELIVERY
BAYS talking to a SUPPLY DRIVER, an INDIAN from the interior. We
can’t hear what they’re saying with the noise all around. The
driver has something wrapped in a tied-up leaf... he opens it to
show Banner...
We can’t see it very well, maybe a FLASH OF WHITE

5.

But it seems to excite Banner. He has his BOOK...it’s more worn
than when he first received it... he opens to a marked
page...compares something in the book to what’s in the driver’s
leaf.
He looks up with a HINT OF A SMILE and nods. He takes out money
to pay the guy...he seems to be asking if the driver has more...
but the guy shakes his head.
INT. BOTTLING PLANT - DAY
Back at work:
The MANAGER has a problem with the machine that
fills the soda from above the bottles ; he comes to Banner and we
can see that Banner speaks a little rough Portuguese.
Banner works on a machine, opening the back of one of those
“ON/OFF BUTTON” boxes, fixing frayed wires. The BOTTLES FLOW
BENEATH HIM ON THE CONVEYOR BELT. The manager likes him, but
can’t figure him out. He smiles.
MANAGER
(Portuguese)
I keep telling you...let me put you on
payroll. I can pay you what you’re worth!
Banner looks up and smiles and shakes his head and in doing so he
CUTS HIS HAND.
C.U. - TWO DROPS OF BLOOD: fall toward the moving bottles.
BANNER: seeing this...sudden intensity, tracking it… he MUST find
where the blood went. Tracking the bottles he thinks were under
him with his eyes...LOCKED on them.
He jumps down and starts moving along with the belt, trying hard
to track them, YELLING at his friend the manager to stop the belt…
The belt stops. BANNER MOVES ALONG IT SEARCHING. And he finds it:
a BLOOD SPOT on the conveyor belt. RELIEF. He wipes it off
carefully. Not noticing...
ANOTHER BOTTLE, with drops of blood dripping just inside the glass
lip, down into the soda. He signals “Okay” and the belt starts up
again.
BANNER: taking out the CRAZY GLUE again.
cut on the edge of his hand.

Applying some to the

The MANAGER: laughs and shakes his head. This guy is unique.
EXT. BANNER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - EVENING
A rough and tumble 3 or 4 story affair, one of the few block
apartment buildings in the tin roof sprawl of the favela.

6.

INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT - EVENING
We can see the details of his essential life, his work, the STRAY
DOG he feeds. Oblique details like rope tied to jam of kitchen
window and coiled neatly on counter. A Styrofoam head with a wig
of dark hair and a baseball cap on it. We notice these things
without emphasizing them. A low bed in the corner against a wall.
Not much else. He's living like a monk.
BANNER is entering, eager to get to work...
He sits at his roughly fashioned WORKTABLE. On it seems to be his
only possessions of note: rows of various SMALL GLASS BOTTLES
with liquid in them, neatly self-labeled and arranged in rows.
One DECENT LOOKING MICROSCOPE. A SMALL FIELD SATELLITE LINK
ANTENNA and a LAPTOP COMPUTER.
He turns on the SATELLITE LINK and the COMPUTER and starts to
Instant Message:
BANNER’S SCREEN: (Banner’s writing in Green, his collaborator’s in
Blue)
“Mr. Blue?”
(a pause)
“Mr. Green...hello. Did you find what you were looking for?”
“Yes.”
“And you have my notes on derivation of the inhibitor?”
“Yes.”
“For most cellular exposures a concentration of 50-80 parts per
million will suffice. Keep me posted. And good luck :)”
And Banner begins to work:
MONTAGE:

BANNER EXTRACTING A CHEMICAL FROM HIS FLOWERS

Over many hours, Banner works. Methodically and painstakingly
extracting tiny amounts of juice from his precious flowers, mixing
it carefully with chemicals from self-labeled bottles and mixing
it all in an assortment of glasses doubling as homemade test
tubes; cooking it down over a small gas flame. Referring to BLUE’s
NOTES on his computer.
Finally, all seems ready...a final step.
He PRICKS HIS OWN FINGER...so carefully placing ONE DROP of his
BLOOD on a glass slide. He slides it under the microscope and
looks at it:
C.U. - BANNER’S BLOOD: red blood cells fringed with a subtle
GLOWING GREEN ENERGY. Like residual radiation.
He takes the slide back out. Takes a breath.

This is it.

7.

In a dropper, he extracts some of the PURPLISH LIQUID he has been
slowly refining from the very small amount in the glass.
Carefully he brings it over the blood sample... and squeezes ONE,
TWO THREE drops onto the blood.
He places the slide under the SCOPE and looks again:
C.U. - BLOOD: The Purple liquid seems to be literally boiling
away around the cells. Frying. No change. The GREEN TINGE is
still there.
BANNER pulls back from the scope and puts his forehead against the
heel of his hands. He had let himself hope and now he is
devastated.
BANNER’S SCREEN:
Green: “No mitigation.”
Blue: “None? Your tissue exposure must be relatively high.”
Green: “Very high.
Blue: “Try a higher concentration. Slightly. 100 parts per million
= lethal toxicity.”
BANNER leans back and looks at: HIS WILTED FLOWERS.
them for all they have.

He has milked

Green: “Impossible at present. Supply is limited.”
Blue: “Not here. We’re making pure synthetic by the gallon.”
(pause)
“Why are we doing this backwards? Chasing flowers in the jungle =
silly. Send me a blood sample.”
Green: “Not prudent.”
Blue: “Living with Gamma poisoning not prudent. Most people not
alive long enough to be helped. Intrigued by your case.”
Green: “Not safe for either of us.”
Blue: “You need help. Gamma not something to mess with.”
BANNER
You can say that again.
He stares at his dead flowers long and hard.

Out of options.

BANNER MOVES TO THE TABLE AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT A VIAL OF HIS
OWN BLOOD.
He labels it “MR. GREEN”
EXT. STREET - MARKET - DAY
At the PACKAGE STAND, sending the blood to Mr. Blue.
BANNER turns and starts away, stops and looks back...he’s taking a
big risk. But he has to. So he turns and walks home.

8.

INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT - EVENING
Packing his computer and sat link antenna in his backpack.
Careful. Always making himself ready to leave. As he closes and
packs the computer we see behind it...
A PHOTO OF A WOMAN (BETTY ROSS):

he stares at it for a beat.

So

Time-cut:
Banner is meditating, seated on the floor, his legs crossed,
calming his mind.
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - MEMORY FLASHBACK
Moving past a Police Cruiser, torn in two, a trooper unmoving on
the ground. Bright lights, accelerating toward him, horrible
sound.
INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT
Back on Banner: PULSE CLIMBS TO 85. He breathes. Calms it.
Time-cut:
Banner in a state of deep meditation.

Pulse: 37

INT. KITCHEN - MIDDLE AMERICA - MORNING - WEEKS LATER
A MOM is making a chaotic lunch for a bunch of seven year olds on
a playdate. Whole thing one camera shot: moving around, staying
with her, back and forth from fridge to table: a plate of apple
slices to get em started…popping the tops off some bottles of
juice and handing them around, stops to take a swig of her own
soda bottle sitting on the counter (we might know that bottle if
we got a close look at it, but we probably don't)… a plate of
chicken fingers and as they're dropped off we see some kids are
drinking… back for something to dip em in…
KID
Mom, I need a napkin!!
We stay with the kid and MOM GOES BACK OUT OF FRAME. Kids laughing
and picking at each others plates and
SOMETHING HITS THE FLOOR OFF CAMERA
Kids faces: all turn frozen staring at something

Mom?

KID (CONT’D)

WHIP PAN: Mom is on the floor, her body in a spasm, eyes rolled
back
MOM!!!

KID (CONT’D)

INT. GENERAL ROSS’S OFFICE - DAY
GEN. T. ROSS at his desk. Lost in thought.
Snaps out of it when his female aide, MAJOR CABOT, puts some
forms on his desk. She moves him through signing boring
requisition orders…
CABOT
...and here’s something a little more
interesting.
He holds out his hand, not that optimistic... she hands him a two
page fax..
CABOT (CONT’D)
Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.
Woman drank one of these guarana sodas.
Had more kick than she was looking for.
ROSS
Last three were irradiated fruit, not
Gamma...
CABOT
Look at the spectrograph in that path
report. Even the FDA didn’t approve
that. Whatever it was it was
concentrated. Got less than a tenth of a
milliliter and it almost killed her.
Ross' eyes narrow: Milwaukee?

He hands her the pages.

ROSS
Get it confirmed.
CABOT
Already put calls in.
She starts out but he stops her, mind alive now.
ROSS
Where was it bottled?
CABOT
Porto Verde, Brazil...

10.

Both look at each other… searching for the same thing.
ROSS
Remember that package we tracked to the
girl that just had a pressed orchid in
it? Year and half ago maybe...?
CABOT
It came from Sao Paolo.
Ross comes alive.
ROSS
Get our Agency people looking for a white
man at that bottling plant. Tell them no
contact, if he even sees them he’s gone.
And get me Sam Greller!
EXT. SPECIAL FORCES BASE - STAGING AREA NEAR RUNWAY
A TRANSPORT VAN pulling up, TWO ARMY SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS hop
out with their light gear and move to join...
THREE OTHER COMMANDOS gathered by the edge of the tarmac. They all
greet each other, one or two introductions, a few know each other.
Who’s our 6?
Blonsky.

COMMANDO 1
COMMANDO 2

COMMANDO 1
Thought he was on vacation?
COMMANDO 2
He got bored. Volunteered.
INT. HELICOPTER - ALOFT AND DESCENDING TO BASE
BLONSKY sits by the open door. Over his shoulder we look down at
the BASE below rising to meet us.
EXT. SPECIAL FORCES BASE - TARMAC
Blonsky is out of the bird and moving with his gear before it’s
even fully come to rest. He moves to join the others.
IN VIEW BEHIND THEM: just stepping out of the Operations
Building...
ROSS stands aside with his old friend GEN. SAM GRELLER.

11.

ROSS
...I know you cashed some chips for this,
Sam. I’m grateful.
GRELLER
Glad to do it. Just make it good.
They shake hands and Ross heads for a waiting...

Soldiers in the rear waiting on intel.
COMMANDO 1
Since when do they fob us off to
Logistics officers?
COMMANDO 2
Ain’t exactly feeling A-Team is it?
CABOT comes back to brief the team. Hands out PHOTOS OF BANNER
and BANNER’S APT BUILDING and SURROUNDING AREA.
CABOT
This is the target and the location.
Insert and grab only, live capture.
You’ll have tranq rifles and suppression
ordnance. Live fire for backup only.
We’ve got help from local but we want it
tight and quiet.
One of the soldiers needles gently...
COMMANDO 1
Little excitement, huh Major?
How’s that?

CABOT

COMMANDO 1
Got tired of pushing paper around?
She’s way ahead of him.

12.

CABOT
I worked intel for 3rd I.D. on the way in
to Baghdad my first tour. I got bumped to
you Rangers in time for Falluja. Says
here me and Blonsky got our Purple Hearts
same week. So, no, I’d very much like to
get back to my office, thanks.
To all of them...
CABOT (CONT’D)
Only way this’ll get exciting is if you
guys screw it up. Any more questions?
No more stupid ones.

ROSS appears behind them.

BLONSKY
Is he a fighter?
ROSS
Your target is a fugitive from the US
government and stole military secrets. He
is implicated in the deaths of three
scientists, a military officer, an Idaho
State trooper and possibly two Canadian
hunters. Don’t wait to see if he’s a
fighter. Put him to sleep.
Blonsky nods.

A good mission.

ROSS (CONT’D)
Each two man team will be issued a
radiation sensor which we will monitor
remotely as well. First blip I want to
know about it.
COMMANDO 2
This guy steal plutonium?
ROSS
Something like that. That’s all.
He and Cabot return to the front.
Team gossips about Ross a little, his dead arm.
Vietnam?

COMMANDO 1

Blonsky shrugs, studying Banner.
COMMANDO 3
I heard he ran R&D, real black box shit.
One of his experiments blew up in his
face, literally. They gave him a desk to
run.

13.

ROSS AND CABOT: his head is back, his moment getting closer.
Hoping it’s not a goose chase. Cabot studying team files.
CABOT
Blonsky’s your point man.
INT. BOTTLING PLANT - DAY
BANNER carting around supplies to the workers at the different
points on the bottling line. As he comes around a piece of
machinery he sees...
THE NICE YOUNG WOMAN being hassled by the FOUR YOUNG TOUGHS.
They are teasing her, blocking her from sitting back down at her
station while the TOUGH LEADER asks her questions:
TOUGH LEADER
Why do you act so shy? It’s not a sin to
have some fun in life...
HER EYES MEET BANNER’S:
He hesitates, torn.

she could use some help.

He really can’t get involved, can’t risk...

But then the TOUGH LEADER tries to STROKE HER CHEEK and she SHOVES
HIS HAND AWAY... AND HE GRABS HER ARM.
TOUGH LEADER (CONT’D)
What are you, too good for us?
AND BANNER ENTERS:
BANNER
Everything good?
They all turn... Her eyes plead with him...
TOUGH LEADER
Dump your load and get lost, mule. We’re
talking.
BANNER
You want some coffee, Martina? With me?
TOUGH LEADER
I said beat it, you want a problem?
He advances on BANNER... Banner backs up.
BANNER
No problem...
Too late...

TOUGH LEADER

14.

He shoves Banner in the chest, hard. OTHER TOUGHS moving to the
sides. The YOUNG WOMAN SCREAMS AT THEM...
PULSE MONITOR: 75...76... Banner holds up his hand...
BANNER
Okay listen... don’t make hungry... you
wouldn’t like me when I’m...
Confusion on their faces -- “that’s a weird thing to say”
BANNER (CONT’D)
...no wait...that’s not right... ah shit.
And the TOUGH takes SWING at him. But BANNER DODGES IT DEFTLY.
He doesn’t hit the guy, he hardly seems to touch him but the guy
goes flying past and stumbles.
TOUGH LEADER gets up and wipes his hands, pissed now.
AND HE PUTS UP HIS FISTS AND COMES AT BANNER PUNCHING
Banner dodges, ducks, weaves and applies his non-aggressive
martial arts techniques, hardly touching the guy but leaving him
flailing like a total fool...
The MANAGER, from the catwalk above...sees what’s going on
MANAGER
HEY!! Cut it out! I got supply sitting
here collecting bugs! You want me to hire
somebody else to move it! NOW!!
The TOUGHS shoot looks at Banner “..another time...” And they
walk away, one of them laughing a little and patting LEADER on the
shoulder.
THE YOUNG WOMAN, sighs and thanks Banner, grateful.
INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT - DAY
Banner lying on his rough bed, THE DOG at his feet.
the ceiling lost in thought when he hears...

He stares at

HIS COMPUTER CHIMES.
He gets up and goes to the screen:
Blue: “Success.”
Green: “Please elaborate”
Blue: “Concentration of 150ppm mitigates the gamma saturation in
your sample. Incredible toxicity but it works.”
BANNER’S FACE: He’s been dreaming of hearing this news for 5
years...but...

15.

Green: “Encouraging. But sample is baseline...I have...spikes.”
Blue: “Tricky. Can you extract sample during next ‘spike’?”
Green: “No.”
Blue: “Spike can’t exceed exposure. What was your original
exposure?”
Green: “Data no longer available.”
Blue: “Toxicity at this level too risky without precision.”
Green: “Will it cure me?”
Blue: “Barring new gamma exposure... good chance.”
BANNER sits STUNNED, mind racing.
On a pad of paper he scribbles:

Data from MAYNARD

Green: “Will get back to you. Thank you.”
Blue: “Pleasure. Hope you walk through the door one day. You must
be a very unique individual.”
Banner closes the computer and stares at the picture of THE WOMAN
(BETTY)... a step closer maybe.
He packs up his core equipment into the knapsack as always.
Then he remembers the note on the pad. He tears it off and wads it
up... nowhere to throw it and so, distracted, he PUTS THE NOTE
INTO HIS POCKET.

of the tail lights of the BLACK VAN and a BLACK CLAD COMMANDO...
...and the COMMANDO sees him ... and IT'S ON.

EXT. CHASE THROUGH THE FAVELA
Streets, alleys and rooftops of the SLUM at night. Late night
crowds of drinkers and people in the streets.
We cut between BANNER, HIS PURSUERS and THE VAN:
BANNER: at a DEAD RUN.

PULSE:

Snaking into the favela.

COMMANDOS: converging in a flat-out footchase.
BANNER:

three hard turns into the back alleys.. PULSE CHECK:

COMMANDOS: splitting with hand signals.
BLONSKY and his partner making the correct guesses about which way
to turn in the alleys, hot on Banner’s tail...
BANNER: up onto trash cans, up onto a tin fence, up onto a roof
and we're rising with him and suddenly…
ROOFTOPS OF THE FAVELA… dropping away in tin terraces below and
beyond. A Maze for a rat-race…
BANNER’S FEET POUNDING ON TIN ROOFS.
BLONSKY: still on the street, catches a glimpse of Banner
skylighted up high, leaping down the roofs.
Reads his angle,
signals his partner to keep following Banner as Blonsky BREAKS
AWAY to cut off his route.
THE VAN: blasting through the night streets of the slum, circling
to come in from the other side.

BANNER:

figures pounding down the roofs, skylighted behind him. A bigger
gap between roofs… he takes it without hesitating and makes it
but...
PULSE MONITOR: goes 101…102…
BANNER: can’t stop, to his feet and off again
THREE COMMANDOS: Blonsky’s partner and 2nd Team, take the same
jump together. More gear than Banner. Two make it, the other
doesn’t. HARD HIT into edge of tin roof and to the muddy street.
No hesitation, up and moving on the ground…

coming from your nine. Got him boxed.
Three more moves. Game over.
ROSS: not celebrating yet… there's an X Factor he's waiting for.
Glances at RADIATION MONITORS… nothing.
STREET: a lot of people out in this part of the neighborhood,
spilling out of bars, walking with girls, easy to get lost in.
BANNER: LEAPING OFF A ROOF he pounds into their midst, turns right
and sees…
BLONSKY: DROPPING DOWN ON HIM AND FIRING A DART
BANNER: Feels the breeze of it and hears it clank into a tin
wall. He turns and bolts into THICK CROWD of revelers.
BLONSKY: up and after him but a lot of people around slow him up.
Loses sight of Banner.
PULSE MONITOR:

109…110…

BANNER: trouble. He can't do this much more before… Runs
through an alley, around a corner. Pops out and sees…

BANNER: instead of turning, DASHES across the street right in
front of the Van and back into the alleys like a rocket.
CABOT (CONT’D)
Okay...Past mobile unit now and heading

BANNER: In the Alleys, breathing too hard.
Has to hide. Hard right into…

Too freaked by Ross.

INT. A FAVELA BAR - SAME
Plenty of people drinking.
toward the kitchen.

Perfect.

Pushing through to the back

SLAM: he runs right into TOUGH LEADER from the factory and THREE
TOUGH GUY PALS. And they are drunk and looking to fight and
nobody better could have showed up.
No chit-chat…the guy curses and TAKES A WILD SWING.

21.

BANNER: can't play dodge games this time and in a swift move takes
the guy's wrist, goes under his arm, grabs the back of his neck
and levers him into the bar…and splits out the back without
breaking stride.
THE BRAZILIANS SCRAMBLE AFTER HIM.
EXT. ALLEY NEAR BOTTLING PLANT/ BOTTLING PLANT - NIGHT
Back in the smallest of the dark alleys...Banner looks up
THE BOTTLING FACTORY looms out of the favela.
TOUGH GUYS: pound out of the alley and move along the side of the
huge FACTORY, hear the SOUND OF A CHAIN RATTLING, come around the
corner and see… A metal door in the back of the factory, it's
security chain hanging too loose. They shush each other and the
TOUGH LEADER directs two into the door to go after Banner and
pulls one with him around to the other side.
SOLDIERS: moving slower, lost their target.
He can't be far. Checking doorways.
BLONSKY:

up on the roof.

Hunting stealthy now.

He sees...

A DARK FIGURE: down below (the last of the Brazilian toughs)
slipping stealthy into the side of the factory.
BLONSKY
Target acquired.
INT. BOTTLING PLANT - CHANGING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT
PULSE MONITOR:

103…102…101..

BANNER: back against a wall inside the dimly lit locker room of
the factory workers. Calming his racing heart. Mind racing. The
wet drip of showers. A CLANK. He reacts… Pulse rising again ...
102..103…
INT. BOTTLING PLANT FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT
BANNER: creeps through this, pausing to listen. Hears the
whispers of the drunk toughs, clumsily following.
Weaving through the innards of the machinery…almost to the far
side now. An Exit sign glowing dim green in the dark… he moves to
it. Pushes gently on the latch and opens it to slide out into…
TOUGH GUY: smiling.
laugh..

He SHOVES Banner back inside with a loud

22.

BANNER: turns to run back into the factory but the OTHER TOUGHS
have come up behind him …and now they are all around him, shoving
and kicking him back inside and up against a piece of machinery in
the dark.
BANNER
Please...don’t do this.
PULSE MONITOR:

109...110...

THE TOUGH: laugh at him and SHOVE HIM up against the massive
machinery near the middle of the floor. THEY TAKE HIS BACKPACK
FROM HIM.
TOUGH LEADER slapping him lightly, taunting:
TOUGH LEADER
What? I can’t understand you. No fight?
Not so tough now, huh? Try those fancy
moves again. Come on, we all want to see.
A HARD PUSH and Banner hits his back into a knob and he CRIES OUT
in pain.
COMMANDOS: Coming through the locker and office area of the
factory hear the yell of pain and the laughter.
BLONSKY: hand signals and they split up.
NIGHT VISION POV: SNAPS ON and turns the factory into a Surreal
world of Black with a very few green illuminated patches. Through
the forest of pipes and metal - dim green shapes of a cluster of
men in the dark.
CUTTING BETWEEN BANNER AND TOUGHS, COMMANDO TEAM, VAN:
VAN:

Night vision on the monitors.

PULSE MONITOR:

Ross and Cabot glued.

111…112…113

BANNER: pinned against the machinery by TWO TOUGHS holding him
now.
BANNER
Stop. Please stop. Me. Angry. Very bad.
TOUGH LEADER
You bad angry, son? I VERY BAD ANGRY!
BANNER'S POV: In the shadows off to the left beyond the men
holding him. A BLACK FIGURE moves through dim light in a crouch.
BANNER's FACE: reacting.

Panic.

PULSE MONITOR: 125…126…127…

23.

BANNER
Let me go! You don’t understand.
Something really bad is going happen
here!!
TOUGH LEADER
Yeah, something bad is going to happen.
NIGHT VISION SCOPE: finding BANNER's face, sighting on his neck.
A MUZZLE PEEKS OUT OF THE DARK AND THEN-ALL AT THE SAME TIME:
BANNER LUNGES, pulling the men holding him
TOUGH GUY SLAMS A FIST IN BANNER'S GUT
BLONSKY FIRES
ONE GUY HOLDING BANNER TAKES A DART IN THE NECK AND SPINS,
CONFUSED
PULSE MONITOR: literally racing up through 180…200...
BLONSKY’S NIGHT VISION: The green cluster of figures, one
crumpling, and one falling and suddenly…
A GREEN PULSE OF LIGHT CUTS ACROSS THE NIGHT VISION
RADIATION SENSOR LED's:

SPIKE into the RED.

VAN: RADIATION COUNTERS SPIKE and ROSS bolts forward in his chair.
BLONSKY: Rips night vision off his head. What the hell was that?
Signals 'hold'.
BRAZILIAN TOUGHS, turning, all stepping away from Banner crumpled
invisible down in the dark out into floor to investigate, two
looking at their friend on the ground starting to freak.
TOUGH GUY
What the hell...?
COMMANDOS in the dark trying to get a fix on what's happening they
hear… Cabot on the com in their ears...
CABOT
Is target neutral? Did we get a shot?
TEAM 2 NIGHT VISION POV: through the obscuring forest of metal,
the cluster of figures, some stepping toward 1st Team (where the
dart came from)., one lying still (the downed Brazilian), but the
other… the hardest to see... very dim even in the Night Vision
but...

24.

...something is happening to that one…dim and obscure behind the
other figures etched in green…
THE SHAPE OF THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND IS CHANGING
BRAZILIANS: Banner's groan in the dark, turns into a horrible
anguished sound…with it the sound of tearing and popping and
cracking...
TOUGH LEADER: just on the edge of shadow and light, the booze
wearing off him, eyes narrowing…something weird is going on but he
can't read it…the SOUNDS of PAIN in the dark behind him distract
him and, angry, he turns-SHUT UP!!!

TOUGH LEADER

He throws a kick into the shadows… and it's the worst mistake of
his life.
His foot meets something hard and faster than you can blink he is
GONE.
RIPPED UPWARD by the leg and into the shadow… His terrified scream
drowned by…
A ROAR OF RAGE unlike anything. PRIMAL. Not human.
ROSS and CABOT:
the…?”

the sound ripping into their earphones “What

THE DARK OF THE FACTORY: The sound of bone cracking and TOUGH
LEADER's TERRIFIED SCREAM OF PAIN and then...
...HE FLIES OUT OF THE DARK, from a height of 14 feet and rising
as he goes... thrown literally across the factory like a child's
ball, clipping through shafts of light and hitting the far wall
head first so hard that you hope he didn't survive.
The ROAR fading… A STRANGE BEAT OF SILENCE, as each face tries to
grasp the IMPOSSIBLE.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS CHAOS:
TEAM 2 NIGHT VISON: from the left: through the forest of pipes,
the cluster of Toughs turn to run from something in the shadow and
… SOMETHING ENORMOUS REACHES OUT after them.
TEAM 1 POV: THE TOUGHS explode toward us out of dark, panicked,
straight at camera the last of them rising from the Dart-felled
friend, a step behind and too slow for THE HUGE ARM THAT COMES OUT
OF THE DARK TO GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM BACK.
BLONSKY: as the TOUGHS sprint past him in the dark, not even
noticing him. HE SAW THAT ARM.

25.

TEAM 3 NIGHT VISION: (from the right side, at a distance). Through
the maze of metal, an ENORMOUS GREEN FIGURE, lifts another green
figure…puny in it's HUGE HANDS, struggling and screaming and then
gurgling and simply going limp as though the life were literally
squeezed out of it like a bug. Dropped like a rag-doll.
And then
THE SHAPE starts to move…
OVER ALL OF THIS:
CABOT
Where’s the target?
Chattered responses on the com.
ROSS
That is the target, goddam it, now take
it out!!
CRASHING METAL. Something isn't moving between the machinery,
it's smashing through it. We can see the tops of huge arrays,
shaking in the light. Sounds of metal wrenching and huge
percussive smashes. And somewhere in all the chaos a button gets
hit and all the belts and bottles start to move. Adding to the
confusion and sound.
ROSS (CONT’D)
Don’t let him out of the building! Put
all your tranqs in him! Every one you’ve
got! Do it now!!
TEAM 2: Advancing forward slightly on the THING IN THE DARK
A Shadow moving among the metal and Team 2 opens up.
THWWP. THWWP. THWWP.

Darts zipping into the dark.

A PATCH OF LIGHT on the concrete floor and the darts fall into it.
Bent at right angles like they've hit a concrete wall.
THE SHADOW SPINS AND COMES AT THEM.
TEAM 2 NIGHT VISION:

A HUGE BLURRY GREEN SHAPE, COMING AT THEM

TEAM 2: whipping up machine guns…
COMMANDO 1
Holy SHIT! GO LIVE! GO LIV-MONITORS IN THE VAN: TEAM 2’s NIGHT VISION, then the image is
awash in blur and static and the...
SOUND OF THAT ROARING RAGE and SOLDIERS SCREAMING.

26.

TEAM 3's POV: In the black, they see the muzzle flashes of two
MP5's open up from Team 2's position, an incredible clatter of
weaponry after all the silent darts, TRACER FIRE streaking out of
them, but not aimed...both LIFTED, rising in the dark and ARCING
WILDLY toward the ceiling, bullets clanging into the metal roof,
taking out bottles of juice on the belt, the muzzles spinning… the
effect almost like a child in the dark twirling two light sticks.
BLONSKY: seeing the same. Despite bullets spraying everywhere, he
doesn't hesitate, HE CHARGES… bringing up his GUN, sprinting past
the moving machinery. He sees THE MUZZLE FLASHES STOP and hears
THE SOUNDS OF BODIES HITTING THE GROUND.
THE SHADOW MOVES AGAIN.
BLONSKY: Drops to his knee with his partner beside him and both
OPEN FIRE ON THE SHADOW as it moves to the right across their
field toward TEAM 3.
If the Roars were loud before they now become truly horrifying…
THE THING in the DARK turns and moves from left to right, the
Soldiers' pan their fire concentrating it on the shadow, most of
it clanking into machinery sparks flying, but…
IN THE STROBE EFFECT OF THE MUZZLE FLASHES, BEHIND THE FOREST OF
METAL...WE SEE THE FORM OF THE THING… MOVING, POWERFUL., SURREAL.
THE HEAD HIDDEN IN SHADOW OVER A GIANT, HULKING FORM.
As the SHADOW moves across Team 1's fire toward Team 3, BLONSKY
BREAKS AND RUNS RIGHT. As always, one step ahead, moving for
position. He sees… A LADDER UP TO A CATWALK RUNNING THE PERIMETER
OF THE FACTORY. He goes for it.
TEAM 3: The Monster coming past their position now, heading for
the EXIT in the far corner...they OPEN FIRE with BLONSKY's PARTNER
moving in behind them and shooting high over their heads…
IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BE MISSING IT.
SOUND OF BULLETS CLANKING INTO METAL mixed with SOUND OF BULLETS
HITTING FLESH… a flat, thick sound.
THE SHADOW TURNS AROUND DIRECTLY INTO THE STREAM OF FIRE
CLOSE UP: FLOOR LEVEL BEHIND A GARGANTUAN ANKLE AND NAKED FOOT IN
SHADOW…THE FLESH GREYISH GREEN.
BULLETS:

LANDING NEXT TO THE FOOT BY THE DOZEN, SMASHED FLAT.

BLONSKY: Reaches the cat walk and spins… Can make out his men in
the dark… follow the line of their tracers into the shadow
… and then a ROAR and a SICKENING RENDING OF STEEL and AN ENTIRE
TOWER of the CONVEYOR BELT is being torn from its base… THE BELT
SWUNG at the SOLDIERS LIKE A CLUB.

27.

FROM BEHIND THE SOLDIERS: The CONVEYOR BELT coming at them…a
giant clothesline of steel. They turn to run and dive but it
catches BOTH OF TEAM 3 in the back, SMASHING THEM TO THE GROUND.
BLONSKY'S PARTNER DIVES, but it tumbles onto his leg, BREAKING THE
BONE. HE SCREAMS.
VAN: All cameras dead.
moaning over the mic.

Monitors black.

Just the sounds of

ROSS THROWS THE DOOR OPEN AND MOVES:
Sir, no!!

CABOT

INSIDE:
THE SHAPE IS MOVING AGAIN NOW… Faster, it's tormentors silenced…
it heads for the back corner, moving under the catwalk where....
BLONSKY: SPRINTS ALONG ABOVE… He can get in position right above
where it's heading if he's fast. He makes it just as the SHADOW
moves under him, braces his gun on the rail, aims for the HEAD
SHOT…
BELOW, LOOKING BACK UP: The SHADOW is moving right at us, still
just a BLACK SHAPE.
BLONSKY above and beyond IT on the
left…OPENS FIRE. THE TRACERS STREAK IN STRAIGHT AT US, HITTING
THE FORM IN THE RIGHT SHOULDER BLADE. ENRAGED IT SPINS and as it
does….
THE CAMERA SLIDES TO THE RIGHT…PAST THE BACK OF THE ENORMOUS
HEAD…and as it passes the head, emerging over the right shoulder…
REALITY DISTORTS HORRIBLY: THE ACID TRIP VERSION OF THE SAME
VIEW. BLONSKY'S TRACERS A NIGHTMARE OF LIGHT COMING AT US…
EVERYTHING STREAKING AND ACCELERATING AND STUTTERING…. AND THE
SOUND: SO OVER-AMPED THAT WHAT WAS LOUD IS LITERALLY NOW AN
INTOLERABLE BANSHEE SHRIEK OF NOISE.
THE HAND OF THE THING RISES IN FRONT OF US, BLOCKING THE STREAM OF
STREAKING BULLETS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.
ON BLONSKY: End of the mag, drops the clip, moves another into the
gun without taking his eyes off the target in the shadows… AND
THEN HE FREEZES.
BLONSKY POV:
THE ARM…RAISED TO BLOCK HIS SHOTS, DROPS, AND THE
MONSTER STEPS HALF OUT OF THE SHADOW.
OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE HULK'S FACE: HALF IN LIGHT, HALF IN
SHADOW...AND IT'S STARING UP AT BLONSKY WITH FURY...AND BLONSKY IS
PARALYZED WITH AWE.

28.

AND THEN WITH A SNARL THE ENORMOUS SHOULDER FLEXES AND THE ARM
COMES UP......AND A FORKLIFT IS COMING THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A
BASEBALL AT BLONSKY.
HE DIVES… IT CRUSHES THE CATWALK WHERE HE WAS JUST STANDING…
COLLAPSING IT PARTLY AND LEAVING HIM LITERALLY HANGING ON FOR LIFE
ABOVE THE FACTORY FLOOR, spinning…. But still able to watch as….
THE HULK bends down into shadow…and with a mighty heave, RIPS A
HUGE MACHINE BLOCK OUT OF THE FACTORY FLOOR AND INTO THE AIR…
RUNNING IT FORWARD STRAIGHT THROUGH THE FACTORY WALL WITH A
TREMENDOUS CRASH.
OUTSIDE:
OVER ROSS' SHOULDER, RUNNING TOWARD THE LOOMING WALLS OF THE
FACTORY until...
THE ENTIRE WALL OF THE FACTORY EXPLODES, THROWING HIM AGAINST A
WALL FOR COVER… HE LOOKS JUST IN TIME TO SEE...
...BEHIND ALL THE METAL, MOVING AWAY DOWN THE ALLEY, OBSCURED.. HE
SEES THE PHANTOM HE'S BEEN CHASING. IT LOOKS AROUND FOR A MOMENT,
EYES GLINT IN THE DARK...
...AND THEN IT'S GONE.
ROSS: CHEST HEAVING STARING AFTER IT.
INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT - LATER - DAWN
ROSS is looking around for clues in Banner’s existence. CABOT is
finishing a conversation with the BRAZILIAN OFFICER.
CABOT
The stuff in the bottles was basic lab
chemicals. Zero intel. Like he knew we
were coming and cleaned the place. Not a
scrap of paper.
As if on cue, BLONSKY enters... with BANNER’s BACKPACK. He thunks
it up on the table...
BLONSKY
Saw he had it on the run, but it was gone
right before I got the shot off... found
it under the machine that our guys got
hit with.
CABOT is already in it. Antenna...COMPUTER. Jackpot. And the
PICTURE OF BETTY. Blonsky examines it.
BLONSKY (CONT’D)
Girlfriend? Maybe she helps him...

Cabot shoots a look at Ross. Hard, expressionless.
ROSS
No, we closed that door to him a long
time ago.
Ross takes the photo from Blonsky and stares at it for a long
beat. Thoughts unreadable.
BLONSKY
Sir, with all respect...Does somebody
want to tell me just what the hell went
down in there? What was that thing?
Ross looks away out the window at the light coming up on the slum.
CABOT
There’s rumors in the street about
sightings...farmer says he saw a gorilla
going into the edge of the forest.
BLONSKY
That was no gorilla. It was 10 feet tall
and green...or gray. I couldn’t tell. But
it wasn’t an animal and you can’t tell me
that thing is hiding somewhere.
ROSS
Two thousand miles of jungle to hide in.
He’s gone.
BLONSKY
What about Banner?
CABOT
Local PD’s on alert. He must have got out
when that Thing attacked us...
ROSS
That was Banner.
CABOT
You think he led us into it?
ROSS
No I mean It...was Banner. It wasn’t an
animal, it was him.
BLONSKY
You’re going to have to explain that
statement.
ROSS
No, I’m not. You did your jobs well,
both of you. We were undermanned and
that’s my fault.

leg hole wide - not as big as her back.

I’d put him at 1500 pounds easily but
could be more. And green. Or gray.
Greenish gray. It was very dark.
I put
three clips on it, sir and didn’t even
flinch. I didn’t miss, I’ll stake my
medals on that.
GRELLER
Captain, is there a medal you haven’t
won?
BLONSKY
Medal of Honor, sir. A high percentage
are given posthumously of course.
Greller rubs his forehead, Blonsky still sharp at attention.
GRELLER
Relax, will you Blonsky? T., you wanna
tell me what the hell you think is really
going on here?
ROSS
Banner’s work was a tangent of Bio-Tech.
GRELLER
You told me you were going to Brazil to
nab a scientist. Are you telling me one
of your Super Soldier experiments got out

I’m telling you that this could be an

BLONSKY
Greller said “Super Soldier”. Do you mind
if I ask...
ROSS
Yes, I mind. You’re asking questions way
above your paygrade, Captain.
BLONSKY
Respectfully sir, I lost two men back
there who had made it through some bad
shit with me. One was on his way out to
have a family. I’d just like to know what
we got mixed up in.

EXT. DINER - AFTERNOON
A classic silver-car diner near the base. Through the plate glass
windows in a corner booth we see Ross and Blonsky over a table.
INT. DINER - SAME
ROSS
...do appreciate your professionalism but
let me emphasize that what I’m about to
share with you is tremendously sensitive
to both me personally and the Army.
Blonsky nods, all ears
ROSS (CONT’D)
I’m sure you’re aware that we’ve got an
Infantry Weapons Development
program...within it however we ran a
subprogram for Bio-Tech Force
Enhancement.

35.

BLONSKY
Super Soldier.
ROSS
Yes...an oversimplification...but yes.
Across the hall they’re trying to arm you
better, we were trying to make you
better. In all the obvious ways and some
not so obvious. Banner’s work was very
early phase, it wasn’t even a weapons
application. It was radiation mitigation,
see if we could give our boys built in
insulation against all that depleted
uranium nobody likes talking about. It
was promising but politicians don’t give
a Flying F about what real soldiers need,
they like big twin rotor heli-planes that
don’t work that they can build in their
states... and so our money was running
out. Banner was so sure of what he was on
to that he tested it on himself. It was
supposed to be very low-exposure and
something went wrong. Or went very
right... I still don’t know.
BLONSKY
Why did he rabbit on you?
ROSS
Banner was brilliant, one in a
generation...but he is scientist, not one
of us. He doesn’t grasp that to have
peace and freedom you need Power. That
people like you and I need instruments to
do what we do.
BLONSKY
So it’d be good to nail him sure, but why
not just take the data to someone else?
ROSS
Because he IS the data. As far as I’m
concerned, that man’s whole body is
property of the US Army.
BLONSKY
I have real contempt for people like
that.
ROSS
You and me both, Captain. You and me
both.
BLONSKY
What about the rest of it? You tried
other things?

36.

ROSS
It was very promising but none of it
panned out. Or, it did but it
was...unstable. Made the subjects
unstable. I wanted to refine it.. but
then Al-Haquid happened and Congress
killed it. No stomach.
BLONSKY
You’ll need something special to go
against that thing. Someone who can
survive to learn how to fight it. I’d be
willing.
ROSS
Blonsky, how old are you? 40?
BLONSKY

37.

ROSS
Why are you still a Captain? You should
be a full Colonel with your record. Shit
you could be a Senator! Take your pick.
Get out of the trench.
BLONSKY
I don’t want to lead. I’m a fighter.
That’s all I want to be and I want to be
the best for as long as I can and I don’t
want to lose a step and if there’s
something I can take to give me an edge,
I want it.
ROSS
Well, I’m glad to see that all that
advertising we do actually works. You
know when I came back from Vietnam I was
27. I looked 45. So you’re beating the
curve. But it takes a toll doesn’t it?
Yes it does.
They clink glasses.

BLONSKY

Mutual respect growing. A team forming.

INT. SECURE LOCKUP/COLD STORAGE - ARMY MEDICAL LABS - NIGHT
Ross admits himself and one medical technician into a secured
medical storage room. It takes codes to get through doors.
Individual codes to open any of the cold storage lockers. Ross
opens one…the fog of liquid nitrogen keeping something preserved.
Ross nods and the technician lifts out the metal canisters…

37.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ARMY MEDICAL LABS - SAME
After hours and off the books. Ross supervises as Blonsky gets
his first injection of the Super Soldier serum. TWO MEDICAL TECHS
make the preparations.
MEDICAL TECH
You’ll get two separate infusions,
dripped in very slowly. One into the deep
muscle, one into bone marrow centers.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
ROSS
We’re giving you a very low dose only. I
need you sharp out there, disciplined.
First side of any side effect and we stop
and you’re off team until you straighten
out. Agreed?
Blonsky nods again.

He’s committed.

EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - ESTABLISHING - DAY
A sprawling semi-rural Southeastern campus.
PANNING WITH TWO STUDENTS walking along a path the camera finds:
BANNER: standing by a tree,
He scopes out the surroundings, not overly intense but careful.
He walks to a BIG STONE BUILDING. He looks up...
MAYNARD HALL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES

(the note in his pocket)

He watches as students and faculty flow in and out. He mounts the
steps and peers through the doors
POV: a SECURITY PASS THROUGH. Guards checking ID’s, a metal
detector. More secure than in his day.
He walks away, head down, thinking...passing ANOTHER BUILDING.. He
stops. Looks at it.
BIOLOGY.

He hangs a moment, deciding then goes in the doors.

INT. BIOLOGY BUILDING - LOBBY
BANNER scans the directory/faculty board.
something... and there it is...
“CELLULAR BIOLOGY - DR. ELIZABETH ROSS”

Searching for

38.

He slips back out the door.
EXT. BIOLOGY BUILDING - SOME TIME LATER - DAY
Banner on a bench: Reading a book and watching the door.
TWO WOMEN talking together as they exit, and one of them is
BETTY ROSS.

Dark, lovely.

He sits frozen: the closest he’s been to her in five years.
And then he follows-Bruce watching Betty: keeping his distance
- she gets coffee with the friend and sits and talks
- says goodbye and checks her blackberry and smiles and types back
She is walking now...He could go to her...and then...
...he sees the guy walking toward her smile. And she smiles back
and accepts his embrace and kiss. This is SAMSON. They link arms
and walk together and Banner has to watch them walk away, Betty's
hand slipping inside Samson's.
Another life.

He turns away and puts himself back on course.

EXT. STANLEY’S PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT
The owner, STAN, early 60’s, is turning the sign on the door to
CLOSED when a figure slides up and knocks on the glass. STAN
freezes as he sees the face of...
BANNER.

Stan looks like he’s seen a ghost.

INT. BACK KITCHEN OF THE PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT
Bruce and the owner catch up. Clearly, they were friends from
Bruce's old life.
STAN
...so many rumors. People say the worst
things without any idea what they’re
saying.
BANNER
Stan, I promise you, whatever you’ve
heard about me isn’t true.
Stan pats his leg...

39.

STAN
I know it. I know people and I always
knew it. But you know how I felt about
you two... Have you talked to...?
BANNER
No. She’s with....
STAN
Samson. Yeah, you heard. He’s a head
shrink. They say one of the best. But a
good guy. Take my word. Reminds me of you
a lit-- Sorry. Bruce, what can I do to
help you?
BANNER
I could use a place to stay a few nights.
STAN
You’ll stay in the spare room upstairs.
Use the back, nobody’ll see you come or
go.
BANNER
Great. One other thing...can I deliver a
few pizzas?
STAN
Deliver all you want, I’ll give Lou the
week off. But someday you gotta tell me
what all this was about.
BANNER
Stan, if I told you, you’d never believe
me.
EXT. CAMPUS - THE NEXT DAY
BANNER ON A BICYCLE, delivering pizzas. He’s even got the
Stanley’s hat. Shades too now, keeping a very low profile.
INT. DORM HALLWAY/DORM ROOM
Banner delivers a pie to a room full of kids studying and arguing
about issues. That used to be him.
EXT. SORORITY HOUSE PORCH/FRONT DOOR - EVENING
A HOT, BITCHY SORORITY CHICK opens the door, others beyond her.
She’s laughing, takes the two pies and bag of extras and sodas
without even acknowledging him... She goes to close the door--

40.

Thanks...

CHICK

BANNER
Ummm...sorry. That’s $46.50
CHICK
Oh...we have an account with Stanley. He
knows us... We’re Theta.
BANNER
I can see that you are. Do you mind if we
call him?
CHICK
Yes, I mind...anyway it took forever and
now it’s cold.
As she says this she pulls out a black olive and on ‘cold’ she
FLICKS IT OFF HER FINGER... And it lands on Banner’s hat...
Oops. Sorry.

CHICK (CONT’D)

BANNER
You know, you shouldn’t make me angry.
You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry
CHICK
Whatever, pscycho.
She slams the door on him. Peals of laughter from inside.
He turns to go off the porch and a fat KEG DELIVERY KID is coming
up the steps... he saw it all.
KEG GUY
Dude, where are your balls? You can’t lay
down for that shit! You gotta smash that
door in and...
INT. MAYNARD HALL - LOBBY SECURITY - NIGHT
Banner enters with two pizzas. Guard looks up. (Lou Ferrigno)
BANNER
I got a delivery on 5.
GUARD
I don’t think anybody’s up there.
BANNER
Oh man, everybody’s bailing... I already
got an medium with no takers. You want
it?

41.

GUARD
Don’t let me stand in the way of
commerce. God bless, brother.
Takes the pizza happily and waves him through.
INT. BANNER’S OLD LAB - HALLWAY AND LAB ROOM
Banner comes down the hall toward his former lab, the place HULK
was born...
The LAB is a large open space seen through half-glassed walls.
Long work tables full of computer terminals. Large Super-Computer
arrays along the walls. It has been turned into a Computer
Science lab in the intervening years.
One lone computer nerd GRAD STUDENT, burning the midnight oil at a
terminal..brain fried, eyes bleary. Banner stares at the familiar
layout and just as the GRAD STUDENT looks up and meets his eye...
FLASHBACK:
Images from the accident that created the HULK. Surreal and
overamped as before but more detailed this time.
- FIRE
- a huge MRI-like machine (the Gamma Pulse) rising above us and
being smashed through glass
-bodies of two of Banner’s grad students lying still under the
control console driven back onto them, a soldier in uniform also
still
- BETTY, still on the ground a gash in her head
- ROSS on the floor, backing up holding his left arm in agony,
trying to reach Betty and looking up at...
BANNER POPS OUT OF IT.
The guy is looking at him... or at his pizza.
Banner opens the door.
BANNER
Those douches in radiation called this in
and then split. You want it?
COMPUTER NERD
Whoever you are, you are my new personal
hero.
BANNER
Hey...you mind if I jump online for a
second?

42.

COMPUTER NERD
Totally. You wanna join my Vice
City...”Manolo, choot this piece of
chit.”
BANNER
Righteous. Gimme a sec.
He sits down and gets to work accessing the University’s
mainframe.
It asks for “USER:

PASSWORD:

“

He types: “Dr. Elizabeth Ross”... then thinks a beat. Tries
“BettyLovesBruce”. Rejected. Tries another of her old ones:
“CellsUnite!”
Bingo.
TIGHT ON: COMPUTER SCREEN and BANNER’S FACE as he searches for the
records from his work. Searching under
- USMD Research Protocol 456-72378: No results
- GAMMA PULSE: No results
Every attempt to find the records of his program yields no
evidence that it ever existed. They have totally expunged all
record of his work. HE SAGS.
RING. He looks up. He is receiving a chat invite from
“StealthWarrior229”.
He looks at it for a long time. The ringing
continues. It’s impossible they have found him here.
Almost impulsively he clicks “Accept”... the VIDEO CHAT WINDOW
OPENS TO REVEAL...
A DIGITAL ANIMATION OF A HUGE MONSTROUS CREATURE, like something
out of DOOM, SMASHING WALLS, RAGING until it finds... A PIZZA.
AND EATS IT. AND THE MONSTER STARTS TO SHRINK, GROWLING
CONTENTEDLY AND THE IMAGE RESOLVES INTO... THE GRAD STUDENT.
BANNER: lifts his head above the computer to look across the rows
of terminals and see...
THE GRAD GEEK: lifting his head above his port...gives Banner
“Thumbs up.”
Banner’s face:

time to go.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - BACK KITCHEN - NIGHT
Banner is talking to Stan...
BANNER
...gone. All of it. Like it never
happened.

43.

STAN
The whole building was closed for a year
after the explosion. Military guards...
BANNER
I don’t know what I was thinking. There’s
nothing for me here. I don’t know why I
came...I hoped...
STAN
What’ll you do now?
BANNER
I’ll go in the morning.
Where?

STAN

BANNER
It’s better if I don’t tell you, Stan.
STAN
I’m so sorry. I wish I could...
BANNER
You did help me, Stan. You’ve got no idea
how nice it is just to see a friendly
face.
THE BELL ON THE DOOR TINGS, a customer entering...
STAN
I’ll just get rid of em and we’ll have
some food...
INT. PIZZA PARLOR - SERVING COUNTER
Stan comes out of the back hearing laughter and looks up and stops
cold...
IT’S BETTY AND SAMSON, grabbing a slice on the way home. He tries
to hurry em along...
STAN
Kids! I got nothing but marinara now...
BETTY
Oh, I need a Mr. Pink, Stan. Please!
SAMSON
She worked through dinner again.
Betty and Samson talk as Stan starts to make up the special
slices... his eyes keep darting to the back...

44.

Tight on: Betty and Samson. He’s telling a story about something
one of his patient’s said. BETTY’s EYES flick down to the food...
BETTY
Not too spicy, Stan...
STAN
I know how you like it...
Her focus comes back up to Stan and behind him, in the back,
MOVEMENT CATCHES HER EYE.

A

BETTY’S POV: BANNER HAS MOVED TO HANG UP STAN’S JACKET AND HAT AND
HE LEANS OUT JUST ENOUGH FOR HER TO SEE HALF HIS FACE.
BANNER’S EYES FLICK UP -- A FROZEN INSTANT: his face only half in
the light.
STAN MOVES AND BLOCKS HER VIEW...THEN MOVES AWAY AGAIN
AND BANNER IS GONE.
BETTY: FROZEN SHOCK
SAMSON’S MOUTH is moving but everything is SILENT. She stares at
the space where she just saw a ghost. But it wasn’t a ghost...it
was BRUCE. AND SHE RUNS. Dashing under the counter and through
the back after him... Samson agape...
EXT. REAR ALLEY OR PARKING LOT BEHIND THE PIZZA PARLOR
THUNDER RUMBLING in the distance, the first drops of RAIN...
BETTY explodes out the back door, looking left and right
BANNER IS WALKING QUICKLY ACROSS THE FAR SIDE OF THE LOT.
BRUCE!

BETTY

He stops but doesn’t turn and she moves toward him, still not able
to believe it’s actually him...and as she draws near.
HE TURNS AND FACES HER and she stops in her tracks, her hand
flying to her mouth...she could literally faint from the level of
adrenaline and emotion shooting through her body.
BRUCE
It’s alright...
SAMSON bursts out the door...
Betty!?

SAMSON

45.

He sees her standing with a dark figure, her hand starting to
reach trembling toward him.
BETTY
When did...? Are you...?
BRUCE
I’m alright. I’m so sorry, I didn’t want
to...
Samson comes up behind her and Banner looks up.
SAMSON
Betty, what happened? Are you okay?
BETTY
Samson, this is....this is Bruce... Bruce
Banner.
He takes Banner in for a beat and then reaches out his hand..
SAMSON
Samson Adams.
And he and Banner shake.
The rain is starting to fall more steadily...
BETTY
Can you...? There are just so many
things... I can’t...
SAMSON
We should get in out of the rain. We’re
just on our way home now. Will you join
us?
BANNER
Yes...thanks, I’d like that. I need
to...uh... Tell me where and I’ll meet
you there in a few minutes.
SAMSON
39 Hillhouse. On the corner of
Maple...by the old...
BANNER
Yes I remember. Alright.
Samson nods and turns with Betty to go back through Stanley’s.

46.

INT. BANNER’S ROOM ABOVE PIZZA PLACE
Banner explodes into the room, and starts throwing his few clothes
into a very small nylon bag. He stops over the sink, looking at
himself in the mirror...
INT. CAR - NIGHT - RAIN
Raining hard now. Samson and Betty pull up through their driveway
and into the garage.
BETTY
I need to go find him...

SAMSON
I think you should...

Samson looks at her, understanding...nods.
SAMSON
I’ll be here.
INT./EXT. A CAR DRIVING IN THE RAIN - NIGHT
BETTY drives through the streets looking for him, desperate. The
RAIN is hard now, a thundershower.
She pulls up to the bigger road leading out away to the highway,
looks right into the dark...nothing. Looks left and we see the
reaction on her face at something she sees...
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
WIDE looking at the shoulder of the road, RAIN pouring down... and
BANNER’s lonely figure, small in the dark walking along.
HEADLIGHTS approach him from behind and he turns and holds out his
thumb and we pan left as the car pulls up ahead of him on the
shoulder, brake lights casting a red glow...
AND THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND BETTY IS OUT AND RUNNING TOWARD HIM.
AND SHE EMBRACES HIM LIKE SOMEONE BACK FROM THE DEAD...AND HE HUGS
HER BACK, FINALLY.
BETTY
Please don’t go away. Please. I need to
see you and talk to you.
BRUCE
I want to...so much. But it’s not safe.
BETTY
I don’t care. Please. You can’t just
disappear again. I couldn’t take it.

47.

BRUCE
I don’t want to make things more
difficult for you. I couldn’t bear that.
BETTY
I want you to come with me now. He does
too.
Banner’s face: torn. What should he do?
EXT. BETTY AND SAMSON’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT - RAIN
Betty’s car pulls in through the driveway and into the garage.
We can see that she is alone in the car.
INT. CAR - INSIDE THE GARAGE
Betty hits the clicker and the garage door descends behind her.
And then BANNER SITS UP IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.
INT. SAMSON AND BETTY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Samson steps into the living room as Betty emerges from the
mudroom/garage entrance. He looks at her...wondering. Betty
holds out her hand... AND BANNER STEPS INTO THEIR HOME.
SAMSON
Welcome. Now both of you go get out of
those wet clothes. I think we all need
some hot food and a number of drinks.
You’re talking, I’m cooking. Now go...
INT. LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM / INT. KITCHEN - INTERCUT
Samson cooking food while Bruce and Betty talk across a small
dining table off the living room. We hear some of what they’re
saying in fragments from Samson’s side of it.
Betty has drawn all the curtains. They are in mid conversation:
BETTY
...and they just let you stay?
BRUCE
I think it was novel at first, they don’t
get the spiritual tourism up there on the
Northern Plateau. And I’m good at fixing
things so... It was peaceful. For a long
time that’s all I wanted.
(MORE)

48.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
When I heard the rug dealer down in town
had gotten internet...my brain started
going and eventually I couldn’t resist.
That’s how I got to Sterns.
BETTY
And trimethodine...
BRUCE
I didn’t think you could synthesize an
inhibitor that complex but he has been. I
mean five years ago...
BETTY
We’re all a lot further along than we
were then, but Sterns is way out in front
on that score. He had some kind of ethics
cloud around him at Cal Tech but it
didn’t stop him. His work is unbelievably
brilliant. So, Brazil for the corablanca?
BRUCE
He’s synthesizing it but I had to try to
get it at the source. It took a long
time just to get there. And I couldn’t
get a thousandth of what I’d need. If
he’s even right...
And now?

BETTY

BRUCE
I go find him, I suppose. I don’t know if
he’s really got something and it’s a much
longer shot without the data but I’ve got
to risk it...
BETTY
No, you don’t.
She gets up and goes to a bookshelf with a vase on it. She shakes
out a small DATA/FLASHCARD on ring, with a lanyard. She goes back
and hands it to him.
BETTY (CONT’D)
I got in there before they carted it all
away. I hoped it would tell us something
someday.
BRUCE
Does the General know you have this?
BETTY
I don’t think so.

49.

BRUCE
He was there in Brazil. When they came
for me. I saw him.
BETTY
Oh my god...he’s crazier than anybody
knows. I’m so sorry... How?
BRUCE
I’ve twisted it round every possible way.
Is there anyway it could have been
Sterns?
BETTY
I hear he’s a total anarchist. Hates
authority. Doesn’t think he should answer
to anybody. That’s why he got in trouble.
Bruce, why didn’t you...?
SAMSON enters:
SAMSON
I think we’re all set.
INT. KITCHEN
Bruce/Betty/Samson eat together at a kitchen table. Convivial,
determinedly light, staying off the obvious weight of it all for a
moment. Samson is telling a funny story.
SAMSON
...and I said “Miss So-and-so, I’ve been
analyzing your ‘condition’ for nearly
three months and I think I can say
conclusively that your issues are more
Caffeinated-UnCaffeinated than ManicDepressive...
They all laugh, even Banner chuckles.
BETTY
...You’re not so much Multiple
Personality as Spoiled Brat...
BANNER
Your problem isn’t ADD so much as
laziness.
BETTY
It makes you sound cruel. But Samson
takes a few of these to pay for all the
free work he does.
SAMSON
Pro-whiners to pay for the pro-bono...

50.

Still laughing... but something has happened. Banner has put his
hand to his forehead and...he is weeping.
Something long-held is being released and he begins to simply cry.
Betty and Samson fall silent, bearing witness. Betty takes his
hand until he pulls himself together.
BRUCE
I’m so sorry. It’s been a long time since
I felt...light...about anything.
BETTY
It’s alright...you’re with friends.
INT. HALLWAYS/BEDROOMS/BATHROOM
All say good night.

Bruce shakes Samson’s hand.

Good night.
Sleep well.

BRUCE
SAMSON

Samson heads for their bedroom. Betty walks Bruce to the spare
room. The moment is bittersweet.
BETTY
Do you need anything?
BRUCE
No. I should go early tomorrow. If I can
borrow cash from you, I’ll take the bus.
BETTY
Of course. I’ll drive you out to the
station.
It’s hard for her to leave him alone, awkward. He looks so tired
and lonely. But she finally turns.
INT. BATHROOM
Betty shuts the door and dissolves, crying hard, silently,
stifling it.
INT. BETTY AND SAMSON’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
She enters. He can see that she’s cried and comes to her. She hugs
him hard
Thank you.

BETTY

51.

EXT. BETTY AND SAMSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT
All the lights off.
INT. SPARE ROOM - SAME
Bruce can't sleep:

Lying in the dark, staring up.

Memory Flash: Betty lying in a sunny room under sheets next to
him, playing with his hand, biting his fingertips
Memory Flash: Betty lying in a coma, turning to see Ross outside
the glass door with two MP’s.
He hears a small thump from the Living Room and turns his head to
listen....
INT. LIVING ROOM
Banner emerges into the dark of the living room, cautious.
SAMSON is in front of the fireplace adding a log to a small fire
he’s got going. He got a pillow and blanket on the couch for
himself and a bottle of wine.
Hey...

BANNER

Samson jumps badly...he didn’t hear Bruce...
SAMSON
Good lord, you scared me...
He sits on the couch and Banner sits in the chair opposite him.
SAMSON (CONT’D)
I thought it might be easier for all of
us...Want some wine? I’m having a lot.
They both start to laugh because there's no getting around it all.
He drains his glass, fills it and gives it to Bruce and keeps the
bottle. They talk in low tones...
BANNER
You’re been incredibly generous. I’m very
sorry to have...dropped in like this.
SAMSON
I think I read a Raymond Carver story
about a situation like this once...
(MORE)

52.
SAMSON (CONT'D)
I seem to remember thinking there was a
lesson in it but it eludes me at the
moment. So much for the insights of
literature.
BANNER
Whatever you may think, I didn’t come
here to see Betty...
SAMSON
Then why did you come?
BANNER
I have a problem...I thought part of the
solution might be here.
SAMSON
Cryptic. But I’ll take it at face value.
I’ll confess something to you if you’ll
clear up some things for me...First, I
confess, as a man...as Betty’s lover...
that I have always hoped you were dead.
Not because I didn’t like you but because
I love Betty and I’ve known that unless
you were really gone, or she believed you
were, that there would always be three of
us in this relationship. I’ve dreaded
the thought of you walking through the
door. But now that you’re here...I have
to admit that I’m very happy about it.
Because I’m also a psychiatrist. And I’m
very committed to putting light into dark
corners, so to speak, and I’m very good
at finding my way into the places people
hide their secrets. I do it primarily
because I think it helps them but also
frankly because I’m interested in what
people have to hide. Betty has a very
dark corner that I have never found my
way into, despite considerable, careful
effort. And the only thing I know about
her dark place is that you are in it.
And I’m wondering if you’ll be honest
enough to tell me: why are you something
that she won’t talk about?
This is said simply, directly...without threat or malice.
BANNER
There are...aspects of my personality
that I can’t control. And I hurt
Betty...in ways I will never forgive
myself for.

53.

SAMSON
You don’t drop your career and fall off
the face of the earth for five years
because you’ve got an anger management
issue, Bruce. You see a shrink.
BANNER
It’s a little more complicated than that.
Samson, I’ve been alone for a long time
now. I have to be. The toughest part of
it is that I worry about what I’ve done
to Betty. If she’s happy and you’re a
part of that, then that makes me very
happy. Honestly. The last thing I want
to do is cause any trouble for her...or
for you. I’d kill myself before I’d hurt
her again.
SAMSON
Totally honest and yet avoiding
something. Exactly like her.
INT. SAMSON AND BETTY’S HOUSE - MORNING
Bruce pulling his sweatshirt on, stepping into the hall. He can
hear Betty and Samson in the kitchen. Talking in low tones...
barely hears....
SAMSON (O.S.)
Just promise me you’ll come straight
home...
Betty steps out into the living room, Samson behind her.
Ready?

BETTY

INT. BETTY’S CAR - CAMPUS ROADS - MORNING
Betty and Bruce drive through campus.
BANNER
Stop a second...
She pulls the car over.
EXT. CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS
Banner gets out of the car and steps up onto the grass and across
the walking paths to a spot with a tree and bench and a view of
the buildings and lawns. Betty moves next to him.

54.

BANNER
What were we doing here? I mean what were
we really trying to accomplish? Do you
ever ask yourself that?
BETTY
We were trying to...understand. Crack a
puzzle. Advance things a little.
BANNER
I think that’s what we told ourselves.
At least the General was honest about
what he wanted out of it. I don’t think
we were as honest.
BETTY
No, you’ve turned this on yourself too
hard. We did talk about it and we were
all comfortable. The worst you can say is
that you rushed it...but you took your
own risks, you didn’t ask anybody else
too.
BANNER
But it wasn’t me that died.
BETTY
Nobody thought something like that was
possible...
BANNER
I don’t know...Nature took a long time to
build us like we are...this whole
delicate wonderfully sophisticated system
refined over billions of years. We come
in and monkey with it...think we can
improve it overnight. Sooner or later
it’s going to blow up in our face...
Thunder rumbles in the distance… a summer storm.
As they are talking… he begins to perceive something odd… people
clearing away from the open campus… is it about to rain again?
In the distance beyond a building: A STUDENT reacting to something
unseen
BANNER’s eyes flick:

Just beyond the far edge of a building

A SNIPER MOVES FOR POSITION...THEY'VE COME FOR HIM.
tenses... He grabs Betty
BANNER (CONT’D)
They’re here.

What...?

BETTY

BANNER
Go home. You’ve got to get as far away
from me as you can, right now! Go!!
And he breaks and runs.
EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS LEFT - DAY
He takes off at a full sprint, moving right to left along the
buildings, trying to outdistance the soldiers before they get a
bead on him...
EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS RIGHT - DAY
Betty starting to run toward the direction they saw the soldiers.
MORE SOLDIERS coming into view, sweeping across the grounds
between the buildings heading in the direction Bruce went.
In the distance, through the campus complex on the road on the far
side she sees FOUR HUMVEES jumping off the road and heading the
same way along the opposite perimeter of the campus. One has a
MOUNTED .50 Cal gun; two have LARGE STRANGELY SHAPED CANNONS
MOUNTED ON THE REAR; One has a FLAMETHROWER on a SWIVEL MOUNT.
Betty starts looking around, frantic...
EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS LEFT
Banner still sprinting to get in the clear; catching glimpses of:
Soldiers on foot giving chase… a Humvee far off behind the
buildings, accelerating along the grass.
BANNER’S POV: THE TREELINE -- out beyond the last of the
buildings and across an open expanse of field.
INT. COMMAND/TECH SUPPORT VAN
Ross, Cabot and technicians, monitoring the progress. Ross is
fuming that the trap got blown...Cabot is already adjusting.

ROSS
Goddam it! We’d have had snipers
on target in three more minutes.
I want to know who waved at that
civilian... They’re going to
Sadr City!!

CABOT
Target on the run, heading 350,
Sniper 2 has the shot. Straight
at your 12 Blonsky.

EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS LEFT / EXT. TREELINE - INTERCUT
BANNER RUNNING:

Eyes reading the field.

Something ahead catches

IN THE TREELINE: a dull flash. Nothing obvious, but light kicked
off something in the trees.
BLONSKY's POV: Banner puts on the brakes and stops, seeming to
stare right at him.
BANNER: alarm bells going off..HE BREAKS TO HIS RIGHT, INTO THE
BUILDING COMPLEX
BLONSKY POV (SCOPE): BANNER turns into the buildings
BLONSKY
Shit. We’re made. He’s going inside.
Blonsky and his men break from cover and sprint to close in from
this side.
WIDE: Blonsky and team explode out of the trees and sprint across
the wide open space between the forest and the buildings
BLONSKY is MUCH FASTER than the others. IMPOSSIBLY FAST.
EXT. CAMPUS BUILDINGS - DAY
BANNER: weaving among the buildings. Getting closed in. He has
to find cover… he sprints through an enclosed courtyard, pulls
open a side door and ducks inside.
INT. STAIRWELL
Kneeling at the bottom of the stairs, ripping off his pack,
fumbling to get something out... THE DATA CARD.

57.

EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS RIGHT
BETTY: Clears the line of buildings and sees the open rolling
lawns of the campus and the park and woods beyond
Then Betty sees:
A BLACK MILITARY MOBILE COMMAND VEHICLE
cruising on the road beyond the lawns, parallel to the action.
She heads toward it…
INT. STAIRWELL
BANNER: He's got a water bottle out of his pack… he rips the cap
off, and then takes the DATA CARD and SHOVES IT INTO THE BACK OF
HIS THROAT, FORCING IT DOWN… SLUGGING WATER TO CHOKE IT BACK… He
coughs and gags but gets it down… He's not going to lose it after
all this.
He tears up the stairs...
EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS LEFT
SOLDIERS: Outside swarming around the base of the buildings
starting to enter doors...
BLONSKY: Reaches the outer edges of the quads, can see that there
are troops and vehicles surrounding the buildings now.
BLONSKY
Look alive, this could get interesting.
INT. UNIVERSITY BUILDING - HALLWAYS
BANNER: At the top floor, around through the corridor, looks out
a window:
POV: Soldiers entering the base of his building.
EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS RIGHT
BETTY: Catching up to the Command Vehicle on road beyond the
grass, running in the grass parallel to it she starts to yell.
BETTY
I know it’s you!

58.

INT. COMMAND/TECH SUPPORT VAN
ROSS and CABOT are monitoring screens, radiation counters. CABOT
looks out the window to monitor movements on the ground and she
spots Betty...
Sir...sir?

CABOT

Ross looks up at her...
CABOT (CONT’D)
It’s your daughter.
Ross turns…sees Betty outside…
BETTY (FROM OUTSIDE)
Come out of there!
Ross throws the door of the vehicle open and jumps out… two
soldiers emerge to flank and cover him … and they stand facing
each other.
BETTY (CONT’D)
Please don’t do this... He needs help!
ROSS
You can’t see this clearly now get
inside.
He moves to grab her arm and she resists...
INT. PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS/ EXT. GROUNDS BEYOND CAMPUS BUILDINGS INTERCUT
BANNER: bursts through double doors and into a GLASS ENCLOSED
PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS, FOUR STORIES UP, leading to the next
building…
SOLDIER’S VOICE (OVER RADIO)
Target is in the overpass. Have visual.
There he is!

ONE OF ROSS’S SOLDIERS

Ross, Betty everybody looks to see BANNER STREAKING ACROSS THE
OVERPASS
BANNER'S POV: through the doors ahead - SOLDIERS. Whips around.
More visible back where he came from.
He's trapped.
GROUND: Ross dashes back at the van...

59.

ROSS
Do not engage! Repeat: do NOT engage!
CABOT
Hold positions, stand down.
ROSS
Put canisters in that tube, one on either
side.
FROM SHELTERING COVER ALONG THE WALLS OF THE BUILDINGS BELOW THE
OVERPASS, TWO SOLDIERS WITH SHOULDER FIRED GRENADE LAUNCHERS STEP
OUT AND AIM UP AT THE TUBE...
AND FIRE GAS CANISTERS UP AT IT.
BANNER: inside the tube looking left and right at SOLDIERS holding
outside the doors at each end of the tube, wondering why they
haven’t moved on him when...
SMASH! The gas canisters BURST through the windows from below on
either side of BANNER, CLANK into the ceiling, clatter to the
floor and immediately start filling the tube of the overpass with
a paralyzing gas.
BANNER’s EYES GO WIDE, reflexively he takes a deep breath and
holds it.
FROM THE GROUND:
BRUCE!!

BANNER DROPS TO HIS KNEES UP IN THE TUBE
BETTY

She breaks from in front of the Command Van and starts running
across the wide grass toward the tube...
ROSS
Get her back here!!
THE SOLDIERS ARE ALREADY SPRINTING AFTER HER.
IN THE TUBE: filling with white smoke
BANNER spots Betty running across the grass get TACKLED BY TWO
SOLDIERS
BANNER'S EYES GO WIDE just as...
ON THE GROUND: BLONSKY ROUNDS THE CORNER AND LOOKS UP AT THE TUBE
FILLED WITH SMOKE...just in time to see...
A GREEN PULSE STROBES THROUGH THE WHITE SMOKE
Blonsky, Ross, Betty and Cabot react…
RADIATION MONITORS in the VAN SPIKE INTO RED

60.

CABOT
Geiger’s lighting up!
ROSS
Alright...now we’ll see.
LIGHTS FLICKER over the Soldiers on either side of the door
SOLDIER'S POV: BANNER’S FIGURE through the double doors… doubled
over on the floor…mostly obscured by the WHITE SMOKE
BANNER'S FACE: MOSTLY HIDDEN IN SMOKE, TWISTED IN AGONY…but even
through the smoke we can see… THAT THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN IS
SURGING A DARK GREEN.
ON THE GROUND: Seen from below the tube is now filled with white
smoke. No figure is visible.
BETTY's FACE, looking up at the tube as...
A HAND AND ARM SLAP UP AGAINST THE GLASS, CLAWING IN AGONY… NORMAL
EXCEPT FOR ITS GREENISH GRAY COLOR
AND THEN THAT ARM STARTS TO SWELL AND RIPPLE, MUSCLES EXPLODING
ALONG THE LENGTH OF IT…
AND THEN THE ARM DROPS OUT OF SIGHT.
SOLDIER'S POV: OBSCURED BY SMOKE.
FROM INSIDE THE TUBE

A MUFFLED HOWL OF PAIN COMING

THE FIGURE IN THE SMOKE NOW AN ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE ON ITS KNEES...
IT BEGINS TO RISE.
FROM BELOW: THE SHADOW RISES INTO VIEW, SLOWLY TURNS, SHAKING ITS
HEAD...THROWS ITS ARMS BACK WIDE AND ROARS...SMASHING ITS FISTS
FORWARD
GLASS SHATTERS ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TUBE, SMOKE POURING
OUT OF IT...REVEALING...
THE HULK.
OUR FIRST FULL VIEW OF HIM… MUSCLES RIPPLING, POURING HIS RAGE OUT
ON THE PUNY PEOPLE BELOW...
CABOT
They should not put this in the
recruitment video.
AND THEN HULK LEAPS DOWN FROM ABOVE, SMOKE TRAILING OFF HIM AS HE
FALLS... POUNDING INTO THE GROUND, MAKING IT TREMBLE. LANDING WITH
ONE KNEE BENT... HE RISES UP TO FIGHT.

61.

EXT. CAMPUS PERIMETER - DAY
The lawns and fields between the campus buildings and the woods.
ROSS
We’re going to Bravo. Move him 360 in
range of the cannons. Keep your cool and
be ready to move. Alpha Team give him all
of it.
Immediately a BARRAGE OF MACHINE GUN FIRE POUNDS INTO THE HULK’s
RIGHT...BLASTING FROM THE SCULPTURE GARDEN. Six Soldiers with
assault rifles supported by a HUMVEE with a MOUNTED .50 Cal.
ROUNDS pepper the Hulk like bees, stinging and enraging him. He
throws up an arm to ward them off but then instead of being driven
left HE TURNS AND CHARGES INTO THE FIRE
THE .50 Caliber STARTS BLASTING
These rounds hit HULK harder, with the flat smack of a bullet
hitting a tree. THEY HURT.
HULK RAISES UP HIS HAND LIKE A SHIELD, THE HEAVY ROUNDS POUNDING
AGAINST HIS PALM AND RAKING DOWN HIS LEGS
BUT HE COMES CHARGING ON and Soldiers scatter...
HUMVEE DRIVER POV:
but too late...

HULK COMING AT HIM.

He floors it in reverse

Hulk raises his fists high and brings them down through the engine
block, CRUSHING THE NOSE INTO THE GROUND.
HANDS IN THE ENGINE BLOCK, HE HEAVES THE VEHICLE UP, THE GUNNER
STILL CLINGING ON FOR LIFE, AND SMASHES IT AGAINST THE MASSIVE
BLACK, STEEL PLATES OF A 20 FOOT HIGH CALDER SCULPTURE, OVER AND
OVER. THE HUMVEE DISINTEGRATES IN EXPLOSIONS OF METAL AND GAS,
SCATTERING REMAINING SOLDIERS
LIQUID FLAME: BLASTING IN FROM HULK’S LEFT, flowing over his
shoulder and back, singing his skin and hair
ROARING HE SPINS BEHIND THE HUGE SCULPTURE, THE ENGINE BLOCK STILL
DANGLING IN HIS HANDS.
From profile now we can see that A MOUNTED FLAMETHROWER ON ANOTHER
HUMVEE is pouring a stream of flame across the lawn at HULK, the
FIRE BLASTING AGAINST THE PLATES OF THE SCULPTURE AND FLOWING
AROUND AND PAST HULK.
THE JET CUTS OFF AS THE VEHICLE MANEUVERS TO GET AN ANGLE ON HULK
AND IN THIS SPLIT SECOND BREAK

62.

HULK STEPS OUT , RAISES THE ENGINE BLOCK OVER HIS HEAD AND HURLS
IT LIKE SOCCER THROW-IN, PULVERIZING THE VEHICLE AND FLAME GUN
WHICH CATCH FIRE, THE DRIVER CRUSHED, THE GUNNER SPILLING OUT IN
FLAMES AND ROLLING.
THUNDER CRACKS and HULK ROARS HIS DISPLEASURE…

ROSS (CONT’D)
GODDAM IT!! I need real
firepower, where’s our air
support?!

CABOT
Base, we need that bird on
target without delay...

ROSS (CONT’D)
If you can’t push him get him to chase
you but move him toward those cannons,
damn it--!
KABOOM:

THE FLAME THROWER AND HUMVEE EXPLODE

INT. SAMSON AND BETTY’S HOUSE
SAMSON: at home in the kitchen. Under the rumble of thunder he
hears the explosion. His head jerks up. Mind starts racing…
EXT. SAMSON AND BETTY’S HOUSE
Exits his front door and hears the clatter of small arms
fire...and he STARTS TO RUN.
EXT. CAMPUS PERIMETER
BACK AT THE FIGHT: SOLDIERS are peppering the HULK with machine
gun fire from UP IN THE BROKEN SHELL OF THE OVERPASS and from
BLONSKY’s POSITION.
HULK IGNORES THEM, bullets smacking his back and CLANKING off the
steel plates of the big sculpture. HULK likes these plates and he
HEAVES AGAINST ONE, tearing it off it’s metal hanging arm, holding
it’s center mounting bolt like the handle of a huge shield. HE
PULLS AGAINST A SECOND PLATE-- the RIVETS POPPING and the SOUND OF
METAL SCREECHING as it tears away.
BLONSKY: Realizing that somebody's got to come up with a better
idea:
Cover me....

BLONSKY

BLONSKY races across the grass straight at the back of….

63.

HULK: with a final pop of rivets the plate tears off. HE NOW HAS
TWO HUGE STEEL SHIELDS, one with JAGGED TORN EDGES like a circular
saw blade.
And then something hard and heavy strikes the back of his head and
EXPLODES UNDER HIM, stinging his legs…
He turns....BLONSKY.
Throwing GRENADES like fastballs, perfect strikes. He's got Hulk's
attention and that's what Blonsky wants.
Remember me?

BLONSKY (CONT’D)

HULK ROARS AND CHASES BLONSKY, wielding his plates like scythes...
Blonsky dodges and fights with what increasingly looks like
impossible (enhanced) strength and speed. LEAPING TO AVOID THE
SLICING PLATES, SPRINGBOARDING OFF OF THEM, WHILE TURNING AND
FIRING HIS WEAPONS INTO THE HULK AT CLOSE RANGE.
ROSS: reacting to his SECRET WEAPON
ROSS
Jesus, he’s doing it... EARS ON!!
SOLDIERS:
on.

in all positions, scramble to pull the ear protection

BLONSKY: at a dead sprint now, actually moving out on HULK a
little
BLONSKY POV: 100 yds out, TWO HUMVEES ABOUT 50 yds APART in the
field...LARGE CANNONS POINTING RIGHT AT BLONSKY
He’s dashing between them.
CANNON SOLDIERS: unsure if they should fire, Blonsky in the field
of fire...
BLONSKY
Hit him....hit him NOW!!
AND THEY FIRE: but these are no normal cannons. The are SONIC
CANNONS, unleashing a murderous cone of low-frequency sound. Huge
circular waves expanding as they warp the air moving at Blonsky
and HULK.
BLONSKY IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT IN THE CROSS FIRE WITH HULK... BUT
HE DIVES OVER 20 FEET INTO THE SAFETY ZONE AND ROLLS, COMES UP AND
LOOKS BACK AT...
HULK: ENGULFED IN THE SOUND WAVES. The first one hits him
slightly from the front left, knocking him down on his right knee.

64.
The second one comes right on the heels of the first, pounding in
from the right, catching him in a crushing crossfire. HIS HANDS
FLY TO HIS HEAD. With his over-amped sense this is the worst
thing that could happen to him.
THE WAVES spill across Hulk and beyond him, expanding and
decimating all in their path. TREES vibrate and split; WINDOWS in
the faces of the buildings explode and BRICK and MORTAR tremble.
SOLDIERS ON THE TUBE: scramble to get inside the building as THE
ALREADY BROKEN TUBE COMES APART.
ONE SOLDIER: from Blonsky’s position who watched the HULK chase
Blonsky past, DASHING OUT OF ONCOMING WAVES.... STUMBLES. GETS HIT
and literally BLOWN SIDEWAYS, Ear protection comes loose, BLOOD
COMING OUT HIS EARS AND NOSE AND MOUTH, his insides PULVERIZED.
HULK: HOWLING IN PAIN. On his knees, his SHIELDS on the ground in
front of him, his skin literally RIPPLING under the waves of sound
WRAPPING AROUND BEHIND HIS HEAD: THE SCENE DISTORTS into HULK’S
REALITY...
THE WAVES ARE NIGHTMARE OF DISTORTION...ALMOST LIKE BEING HAMMERED
BY STEEL. THE WORLD A DISTORTED BLUR BEYOND ANYTHING WE’VE YET
SEEN.
DARK GREEN BLOOD TRICKLING OUT HIS EARS: his brains are literally
being scrambled.
Nets!

ROSS

SOLDIERS in two TWO MAN TEAMS with RPG-like UNITS, run forward
into the point of the ‘V’ between the cannons waves and FIRE...
NETS...EXPANDING WEBS OF SUPER-STRONG STEEL CABLES DROPPING OVER
HULK
HULK FALLS FORWARD ONTO ONE FIST, TRYING TO HOLD HIMSELF UP, HIS
ARMS STICKING THROUGH THE NETS.
BETTY: can’t take anymore
BETTY
You’re killing him!
She starts to run toward him but the same SOLDIERS chase and HOLD
HER BACK.
SAMSON: dashing past the last edge of the CAMPUS RIGHT buildings
and running toward the Sculpture Garden sees...
CARNAGE: Soldiers and metal lying at the foot of the sculptures,
the smoking wreckage of the Flamethrower vehicle

65.

AND AN IMPOSSIBLE SIGHT: A HUGE GREEN HULKING FORM engulfed in
nets and waves of distortion... he looks right, searching...
Betty - held by two soldiers straining toward the THING.
BETTY!!

SAMSON

And as he shouts this Betty strains forward screaming at the HULK:
BRUUCE!!

BETTY

SAMSON: following her gaze back to the HULK. And suddenly Samson
understands what was in that dark corner she wouldn’t let him
into. He stands gaping at the impossible.
ROSS: moves to pull Betty back to the van.
BRUCE!!

BETTY (CONT’D)

HULK: Hears her scream and turns his head and SEES BETTY AND HEARS
THAT NAME.
A GREEN PULSE IN THE BASE OF HIS SKULL AS RAGE COURSES THROUGH
HIM:
His strength and form visibly swell and he STRAINS upward, raising
one of the plates….but the sound waves are too much for him and he
DROPS THE PLATE AGAINST THE OTHER ONE
CLANG: The clanging of the metal, disrupts the waves around him
for a just for a second and he feels it…
With TITANIC EFFORT, his arms sticking through the nets…he heaves
up on the steel plates, every muscle straining and bursting with
new power, he spreads his arms wide and SMASHES THE PLATES
together like giant CYMBALS…
THE CRASH is unbelievable and the vibrations push the SONIC WAVES
clear of him for a moment and in this moment of freedom...
With his right arm HE HURLS ONE PLATE LIKE A MASSIVE THROWING STAR
AT THE LEFT-HAND CANNON and THE PLATE CUTS THE HUMVEE AND THE
CANNON IN HALF and possibly its operator too.
THE SOUND WAVE IS COMING BACK INTO FOCUS from the remaining cannon
but now HULK HAS HIS OTHER BIGGER SHIELD UP IN FRONT OF HIS LEFT
SHOULDER and the SOUND POURS AGAINST IT AND OVER AND AROUND IT.
IN THIS SHELTER he rips the nets off of himself with his right
hand.
AND LEANS THE SHIELD AGAINST THE SOUND WAVES AND BEGINS TO
ADVANCE.

66.

BLONSKY AND OTHERS FIRE ON HIM HITTING HIS LEGS but..
LEANING INTO IT LIKE A MAN WALKING INTO A FIREHOSE HULK CLOSES ON
THE CANNON,
BENDS DOWN, and LEAPS UP AND OUT OF THE CONE OF SOUND, AND COMING
DOWN WITH HIS SHIELD DIRECTLY ON THE CANNON, SMASHING IT AND THE
WHOLE REAR OF THE HUMVEE AS NEATLY AS A CAR-CRUSHER IN A JUNK
YARD.
SILENCE:
HULK steps off the crushed car, Shield in his left hand.
PILOT’S VOICE (OVER RADIO)
Two minutes out, Major...
ROSS
All positions, keep him engaged, don’t
let him leave and prepare to fall back on
my order...
Nobody moves.

Nobody’s engaging that THING anymore...

Except BLONSKY. He gets up and comes at Hulk. UNLOADS HIS FINAL
CLIP at Hulk just to get his attention as he circles round to face
him. Whips up an M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHER, breaks the short fat tube
open and loads a MORTAR ROUND.
HULK stands strangely still...watching Blonsky.
PILOT’S VOICE
Closing...what’s the target?
CABOT
290 from my position, 300 yds, ten feet
tall and green
Come again.

PILOT’S VOICE

ROSS
You heard right. Put everything you’ve
got on it. Take it out. Ground teams pull
back...
ROSS/CABOT/BETTY POV: across the grass, BLONSKY on the right
squaring off against HULK, huge on the left, dwarfing him.
BLONSKY
Come on, Banner!! That all you got!?
ROSS (OVER RADIO)
Blonsky, fall back now!

67.

HULK’S EYES NARROW. THIS ONE HE REALLY DOESN’T LIKE. HE LIFTS HIS
SHOULDER WITH THE SHIELD AS THOUGH HE MIGHT SWING IT.
BLONSKY
Come on let’s see what else you’ve g-SMASH!! WITH BLINDING SPEED, HULK SNAPS HIS FOOT OUT AND CATCHES
BLONSKY TOTALLY FLATFOOTED
THE WHOLE BOTTOM OF HULK’S MASSIVE SOLE MEETS BLONSKY’S BODY
SQUARE ON, INSTANTLY BREAKS EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY AND SENDS HIM
HURTLING 50 YDS IN THE AIR, LANDING AND SKIDDING FOR 100 YDS MORE
THROUGH GRASS, SKIDDING LIKE A LIMP BROKEN DOLL.
THE THUNDER CRACKS AND IT BEGINS TO RAIN.
HULK TURNS TOWARD ROSS AND BETTY’s POSITION AND STARTS WALKING
TOWARD THEM.
ROSS
Fall back! Bird hitting the deck, fall
back!
In the distance, maybe the first faint dull THWOP of a rotor.
SOLDIERS in Ross’s team scrambling back across the road. Piling
out of the command van...
ROSS and CABOT hustling too...abandoning the van. Ross’s eyes dart
to his soldiers who held Betty...they’re moving across the road...
The next all happens within seconds:
ROSS TURNS TO SEE... BETTY MOVING TOWARD HULK ACROSS THE GRASS
SAMSON: watching wide-eyed as BETTY steps up to the monster, hears
a sound behind him and turns.
AN APACHE GUNSHIP ARCS IN OVER TREES, LOW IN THE DISTANCE and
HOVERS INTO POSITION.
C.U.- GUNSHIP TARGETING COMPUTER: target acquisition zoning in on
the massive form of the HULK’s BACK, not seeing Betty on the other
side of him
HULK and BETTY face each other. Betty reaches a hand up to touch
his arm...
Bruce...?

BETTY

Dim recognition on Hulk’s face
PILOT’S VOICE (OVER RADIO)
Hold onto your hats...

68.

ROSS
Hold fire---!!!
TOO LATE -- MASSIVE GATLIN CANNONS OF THE APACHE UNLOAD, TEARING
UP THE EARTH AROUND HULK AND BETTY
NO!

SAMSON

BETTY instinctively presses into HULK’s body for shelter.
ROUNDS POUND INTO HULK’S BACK...SOME ACTUALLY SLICE THROUGH THE
FLESH OF HIS LEGS, TEAR THE SKIN ON HIS BACK
KEEPING BETTY BEHIND HIM, HULK TURNS TO FACE THE ONSLAUGHT,
ROARING..
THE APACHE STARTS TO ACCELERATE TOWARD HIM TO BRING THE FULL
CONCENTRATION OF FIRE ON HIM
CEASE FIRE!!

CABOT

THE GUNSHIP is a quarter mile away now and very low and coming on
fast.
HULK TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS THE
MASSIVE PLATE THROUGH THE AIR
THE GUNSHIP never sees the MISSILE until it’s too late
IT RIPS THROUGH THE ROTOR TOWER, LITERALLY CLEAVING THE WHOLE MAIN
ROTOR OFF THE SHIP
AND THE SHIP GOES DOWN...NOSE FIRST, DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
PASSES OVER SAMSON
PLOWING INTO THE GROUND 50 YDS FROM HULK AND BETTY
HULK SPINS HIS BACK TO THE EXPLOSION, WRAPPED AROUND BETTY.
THE GUNSHIP EXPLODES, THE FLAME AND METAL TUMBLING ALONG THE
GROUND AND COMPLETELY ENGULFING HULK AND BETTY.
EVERYBODY KNOCKED TO THE GROUND BY THE CONCUSSION OF THE FIREBALL.
From the ground Ross looks up at the inferno that probably killed
his daughter, and sees...
HULK EMERGING FROM THE FLAMES, CRADLING AND SHELTERING AN
UNCONSCIOUS BETTY.
HE SNARLS AT ROSS, THEN THUNDER CRACKS AND HIS HEAD JERKS UP
SENSING MORE ASSAULT....
RAIN STARTS POURING DOWN

69.

AND HE RUNS.... ACROSS THE LAWNS, PAST SOLDIERS AND WRECKAGE, PAST
BLONSKY’S BODY, HIS STRIDES LENGTHENING WITH EACH STEP
SMASHING INTO THE TREES AND OUT OF FRAME INTO THE DARK.
EXT. BETTY AND SAMSON’S HOUSE - DAY - RAIN
Samson stands in the empty garage
ROSS (O.S.)
You did the right thing calling us.
REVEAL: ROSS, standing in the garage with Samson.
MILITARY VEHICLES wait in the street.
ROSS (CONT’D)
You’re doubting it now because it went
bad but your instincts were right. You
see who he is now...what he is.
SAMSON
No, I don’t actually. He wasn’t what I
thought he’d be at all. It was strange
to me that she would never say what had
happened between them...she’s one of the
most honest people I know. But it was
this, wasn’t it?
And you knew about it
too...you were all a part of it?
ROSS
I need to know where they’re going.
She’ll be in incredible danger as long as
she’s with him.
SAMSON
From who? He protected her. You almost
killed her.
ROSS
I give you my word that her safety is my
main concern at this point. Bruce’s as
well. I care about him more than you
realize. I don’t want to hurt him, I want
to help him.
SAMSON
You know it’s a point of professional
pride with me that I can always tell when
somebody is lying. He wasn’t...and you
are. But I don’t know where he was going.
I know that she’ll help him if she can.

70.

ROSS
Then she’ll be aiding a fugitive and I
won’t be able to help either of them.
Ross walks out the driveway to his waiting van.
SAMSON
I used to wonder why she never talked
about you...now I know.
Ross walks away without looking back.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - RAIN
Hulk emerges from the trees in the rain holding Betty
Hulk

spies a cave opening in the rocks…

EXT./INT.

CAVE - NIGHT

HULK lays her gently down inside the opening out of the rain. This
wakes Betty and, disoriented she reacts in terror to the monstrous
face next to hers...
SHE SCREAMS AND PUNCHES HIM reflexively...HE GROWLS surprised.
BETTY
Oh no...I’m sorry...I’m...
But he is already standing up. He can't fit under the roof so
stands in the entrance.
Betty stares up at him. Then she notices...THAT HE IS WOUNDED.
HULK SHOT: over his left. Betty stands and comes toward him.
You’re hurt.

BETTY (CONT’D)

And as we slide across behind the head REALITY MORPHS into HULK’S
VISION...hallucinatory, distorted. BETTY fractured into two, the
SOUND OF RAIN like an acid sizzle, etc...
BETTY (CONT’D)
Bruce, can you understand me? Are you
hurt?
Betty’s voice cuts through the bad Trip he's on and things
actually settle and straighten out a bit but then...
WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING…seen still in our HULK VIEW.
Supercharged, annihilating, terrifying.

71.

HULK’S FACE: RAGE explodes in his face and he whips around looking
for the source of the assault, ROARS and the woods, grabs a
MAMMOTH ROCK and as the THUNDER CRASHES, HURLS IT AT THE SKY. HE
ROARS BACK AT THE THUNDER.
BETTY (CONT’D)
It’s okay...we’re okay.
She steps out in the rain and touches his arm and he turns, still
growling... She takes his massive hand
BETTY’S POV: CLOSEUP ON HULK’S ARM - in the deep cuts we can
LITERALLY SEE HULK’S BODY HEALING ITSELF
BETTY (CONT’D)
Come here... come on.
She pulls him down out of the rain and he huffs and sits down and
she sits with him. She sits with him calming him.
FROM WIDE OUTSIDE THE CAVE we can see the outline of the two of
them sitting together in the dark, lightning pops a flash on the
image of the woman and the monster sitting together....BLACKOUT.
INT. ARMY BASE HOSPITAL WARD - SAME NIGHT
Ross is coming into the ICU with a DOCTOR
ROSS
Will he walk again?
DOCTOR
Most of the bones in his body look like
crushed gravel right now. If he lives
he’ll be lucky if he can lift the straw
to eat his liquid meals.
They come to BLONSKY’s BED.

He has every tube imaginable in him.

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
I will say this, he’s got a heart like a
machine. Never seen anything like it
outside a race horse.
EXT. CAVE - MORNING
Bruce and Betty wake up in the cave. He tries to rise and
retches. Bruce has scars all over his body where the Hulk’s
wounds were made.

72.

EXT. MOTEL - DAY
Appalachia or maybe the Smokies. Some little nowhere town in the
mountains. BETTY is coming along the ground floor units with a
KEY.
Bruce emerges from behind the ice machine, wearing her coat over
his nude torso and shredded pants. She helps him into the room.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Banner emerging from the shower, a towel around him. Bathroom full
of steam. No sign of Betty.
FOCUS ON: BANNER’S BODY -- ALL SCARS ARE GONE. Totally healed.
Tighter on Banner:

He wipes steam off the mirror and...

THE HULK’S FACE SNARLS AT HIM -A FLASH of Hulk-Memory of the GUNSHIP ROUNDS coming at him
No more than a flash but it doubles him over the sink.
Jump cut: few minutes later
The door the room opens and Betty comes in with a number of
SHOPPING BAGS. She hears...
BANNER THROWING UP in the bathtub. She waits, concerned.
emerges.
BETTY
Still feeling sick?
BRUCE
No, I feel better.

Getting my data back.

He holds up the little data Flash Card. It worked.
BETTY
I think I’ve got a good selection for
you. First things first...
She tosses him a new PULSE MONITOR.
BRUCE
You’re kidding me...
BETTY
Target: they’ve got everything. Okay, it
ain’t Armani but...

He

73.

He puts it on as she starts showing him clothes. She holds up a
large pair of STRETCHY PURPLE PANTS
BRUCE
I’m an irradiated freak, that doesn’t
mean I’ve lost my sense of style.
He changes. His hair is an unkempt mess.
BETTY
When was the last time anybody but you
cut your hair, Mr. Style Council?
Timecut: Bruce in a chair with a towel around his shoulders.
Betty cutting his hair. He checks suspiciously with his fingers.
BETTY (CONT’D)
I have done this before.
He drops his head forward, letting her rub his neck a little.
BETTY (CONT’D)
I don’t know how you’ve done this alone.
BRUCE
With clippers usually...No, I didn’t want
you to be afraid all the time.
BETTY
It is frightening. But it was worse not
knowing...
He twists around and THEY ARE KISSING and it all breaks loose.
PUSHES HER TOWARD THE BED AND ONTO IT and MOVES ON TOP OF HER
PULSE MONITOR: 89...90...91
He hears it..glances:

94...95

He slows...anguished

BRUCE
No, wait...I’m sorry...
What...?
We can’t...

BETTY
BRUCE

BETTY
It’s okay...I want to.
BRUCE
No... I can’t. I can’t get too...excited.
She understands now. They want to and know it but they can’t.

He

74.

BETTY
Not even a little excited?
Banner studies her face, he’s imagined this moment so many times.
BRUCE
I thought I couldn’t risk this...that it
was better to deal with it alone. But it
wasn’t...this is better. I wanted so
much to...it was so hard just to move
from place to place...so risky. I sent
you small things to try to let you
know... I sent you a Canthia Tigris from
Brazil. I don’t know if...
I got it.

BETTY

BRUCE
I’m so sorry...so sorry...
She stops him and shakes her head and kisses him.
INT. ARMY BASE - PLANNING ROOM / INT. PENTAGON OFFICES - NIGHT INTERCUT
Ross is at a desk off the open room of a Strategic Operations

over the following dialogue.
REPORTER
Rumors continue to swirls about a violent
clash between forces of the US Army and
an unknown adversary on the campus of
Southern Polytech earlier today...
Authorities have renewed the long-cold
hunt for fugitive government scientist
David Bruce Banner....
BANNER’S PICTURE fills the screen.
Ross on the phone with SAM GRELLER...speaking hurriedly,
overlapping each other.
ROSS
...for goddsake Sam, the National Guard
can’t get tents to hurricane zones in

GEN. GRELLER: standing in the foyer outside the large paneled
doors of a Pentagon Conference room.
GRELLER
It’s domestic on paper so Guard and FBI
have to be involved...
ROSS
FBI!! Did the Chiefs get a look at those
tapes?! Do they think that was a video
game?
GRELLER
They saw them, nobody’s doubting
anymore...
ROSS
What’s the FBI gonna do...pull out
badges? Why don’t we get ATF while we’re
at it!
GRELLER
It’s formalities, T. Use em for intel and
then tell em to back off. The Chiefs are
giving you total authority to run this
operation. Make your list of what you
need and get back to me.
Ross hangs up. Looks up at the news in time to catch:

No you can keep that.

CABOT
...Federal is already monitoring phone,
plastic and Dr. Ross’s web accounts, and
local PD’s have been put on alert...
They’ll pop up somewhere and when they do
it comes straight to us...
ROSS
They won’t just pop up. He made it five
years and got across borders without
making a mistake and he won’t use a damn
credit card now. If he was trying to
escape he’d be long gone. But he’s not
trying to escape...he’s looking for help.
And that’s how we’re going to get him. We
don’t know where they’re going but we
know what they’re after and we know he’s
been talking to somebody. You’ve all got
copies of that correspondence. There are
only a few hundred people in world who
have what he needs. Figure out who they
are, he’s going to one of them.

How long have you known Samson?
BETTY
About a year and a half. He came to
lecture on a fellowship and stayed.
BANNER
Do you trust him?
Yes.

I do.

BETTY
Bruce, you know that I...

BANNER
You don’t have to explain anything to me.
Ever. He seems like a good man and he
treats you well and that makes me happy.
BETTY
He does. I never trusted him with this.
Trust isn’t the right word. I didn’t test
his faith in me by asking him to believe
something I still can’t believe myself.
BANNER
Who could? Sometimes I even convince
myself it’s not real.
BETTY
What is it like...when it happens? What
do you experience?
BANNER
Remember those clinical experiments we
volunteered for at Harvard? The induced
hallucinations? It’s like that, amplified
by a thousand. It feels like someone is
pouring a liter of acid into my brain.

IT knew me. Maybe your mind is in there
it’s just...overcharged...can’t process
what’s happening. You know Samson works
with people on ‘conscious dreaming’,
helping them direct themselves out of
their nightmares even though the
conscious brain seems asleep... maybe...
BANNER
I don’t want to control it. I want to
get rid of it. It kills people. It
almost killed you. I didn’t do those

That’s from Quantico. They’re getting

CABOT sighs... She nods and the OFFICER goes out. She rubs her
temples and stares at her COMPUTER. Gets a ‘what the fuck’ look on
her face and types:
SCREEN:

Google Search: “Mr Blue cellular biology”

A bunch of links come up and she clicks one and gets:
A YOU TUBE VIDEO: Scientist JR STERNS holds a press conference to
demonstrate a breakthrough for medical science.
STERNS
“...full cell saturation, a method of
moving desired compounds into every cell
in the body which will revolutionize
medical therapies.”
VIDEO: Sterns puts an inert blue dye into a WILD LOOKING MACHINE
hooked up to a YOUNG GRADUATE STUDENT.

In front of our eyes, the student starts to TURN BLUE. PEOPLE
laugh and clap at the demonstration.
STUDENT (O.S.)
What’s his name?
STERNS
Who, Mr. Blue here?
CABOT: BOLTS FORWARD, EYES WIDE. Her fingers fly across the
keyboard, typing in the name “JR STERNS cellular biology”
A Google link appears for Columbia University. Cabot clicks on the

STERNS

INT. STERNS’ LAB - DAY - SOME TIME LATER
The lab has a bit of the ‘Mad Scientist’ clutter to it. Sterns
speaks very quickly.

85.

STERNS
...it took some work, let me tell you,
we’ve never tried to concentrate the
trimethodine a tenth of what your peak
exposure correlates with. That you
survived an event like that to stand here
and discuss this....it has something to
do with Dr. Ross’s protein primer
capacitating the cells of course, but
it’s beyond my reckoning...we could study
it for years.
BETTY
But you think you’ve got the
concentration right?
STERNS
Well yes...on paper anyway. And my cell
saturation will make sure we don’t miss
any spots...but...even if we hit the
levels right, I can’t promise this will
cure you. It might only be an antidote to
suppress the specific flare up.
When you have one of these ‘spikes’ ...
is the experience extreme?
BANNER
You might say that.
STERNS
Well I can’t wait to see it! You know I
must say...I wondered if you were real.
And if you were I wondered what it would
look like...a person with that much power
lurking in him. Nothing could have
surprised me more than this unassuming
young man shaking my hand!
(hesitates)
I’d be remiss however if I didn’t point
out that these concentrations carry
extraordinary levels of toxicity. If
we’re over by even a small integer, the
residual could kill you. Will kill you.
BANNER
There’s a flip side to that ... if we
miss on the low side...if we induce me
and it fails...it will be very dangerous
for you.
STERNS
I’ve always been more curious
cautious. It’s served me well
if that’s what kills this cat

around a few corners.

EXT. MILITARY BASE - EVENING
Ross’ forces mobilize. A Sikorsky winding up its jets.
INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Blonsky stands alone, staring at himself in the mirror, studying
his own face. Something is changing in him. HIS SHOULDERS AND
NECK SEEM TO HAVE GROWN MASSIVE LITERALLY OVERNIGHT.
As he studies his body and face, we pull round to his reflection,
back over his shoulder, further back revealing his naked back and
we can see something that even he can’t...
...SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO THE BONES IN HIS SPINE.
They have become too big, almost simian, protruding from between
his enlarged back muscles in a disturbing way.
EXT/INT. SIKORSKY - EVENING
Blonsky loads in with OTHER SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS. There are
THREE TWO MAN SNIPER TEAMS WITH SPECIAL THERMAL SCOPES AND RIFLES
AGAINST ONE WALL.
BLONSKY sits against the wall next to a familiar face, a SOLDIER
who was in the campus fight with him.
SOLDIER
How you feeling, man?
BLONSKY
Like a monster.
Blonsky grunts aggressively and flexes his arm. HIS ARM MUSCLE
ACTUALLY TEARS HIS SLEEVE A LITTLE. The other soldier shoots a
look around.
Cabot and Ross come back to the rear to brief the team. She has
copies of BLUEPRINTS OF THE LAYOUT OF STERNS BUILDING AND
SURROUNDING BUILDINGS
BLONSKY (CONT’D)
Back on the Hulk Hunt, Major...
CABOT
Banner is the target. Snipers have the
point. Delta in backup. If we make it
before they move we’ll have two tries. If
we can’t take him inside, we’ll try for a
shot as he exits.
(MORE)

87.
CABOT (CONT'D)
If we can’t hit him unaware before he
makes the street then plainclothes will
try to follow and we stand down. Under no
circumstance is Banner to be engaged
directly. If we can’t get a shot we fall
back and let him go.
BLONSKY
And if he goes nuclear?
ROSS
Then we’ll have failed to learn from our
mistakes, won’t we? You’ve got the
compact sonics. Try to at least move him
out of the city center toward the river.
Then disengage. We’ll follow from the air
but not fight. Any questions?
BLONSKY
Not much of a rematch.
CABOT
1.5 Million people within a five mile
radius. You want to fight that thing
here?
Cabot steps to the front of the cabin, sits near Ross.
CABOT (CONT’D)
You sure about your boy?
ROSS
I need a dog in the hunt that’s not going
to run from a bear if it shows up. If we
do this right, I’ll never have to let him
off the leash.
INT. STERNS’ LAB - EVENING
Sterns and Betty make the preparations to ‘treat’ Banner. There is
a table that looks disturbingly like a set-up for a lethal
injection. A little bit of a Frankenstein vibe too.
Banner strips to his lycra shorts and gives his clothes to Betty.
BANNER
Think of all the money I’ll save on
wardrobe if this works. If this starts to
go bad, promise me you won’t stay and try
to help me.
Bruce...

BETTY

88.

BANNER
It’s the worst when it starts. You have
to promise me you’ll run or I can’t do
this.
Betty nods.

Sterns indicates the nylon medical restraints.

STERNS
If you have a strong reaction these will
keep you from hurting yourself.
BANNER
If I have a strong reaction you’re not
going to need to worry about me.
Banner climbs on the table. Sterns tilts it back so that Banner is
still at a slight angle and begins to strap him in.
Sterns puts an I.V. in each of Banner’s arms and legs linked to
the CELL SATURATION MACHINE which he primes. A canister with the
antidote and some sort of futuristic spinner or plunger to send it
through his body. Then he puts contact pads connected to
electrical wires on Banner’s temples. And finally a plastic bite
suppressor for Banner’s mouth. Banner shakes it off.
Ready?

STERNS

STERNS JOLTS BANNER WITH ELECTRICITY. A lot of it. It hits him and
HIS WHOLE BODY SPASMS, every muscle in his body straining against
the straps, eyes clenched and then CLOSE ON BANNER’S EYES: snapping open, GREEN LIGHT glowing.
A PULSE OF GREEN in the base of his skull sends green Gamma energy
shooting through his body, HIS SKIN FLOODS WITH COLOR FROM TOP TO
BOTTOM, SPREADING FROM THE BASE OF HIS SKULL AS THE GAMMA ENERGY
SHOOTS OUT OF HIS BRAIN.
My God...!

STERNS (CONT'D)

BETTY
There’s more. Wait for it!
Now we see the full agony of it as Banner’s body starts to swell
and stretch and harden. We should feel the trauma of it on his
bones and muscles. Sterns is staggered. Betty watches the man she
loves be tortured in front of her, he howls in agony. Sterns steps
closer...too close.
The restraints pop like rubber bands, one of them striking Sterns
who gets knocked back and dazed...The Hulk is appearing on the
table, still in spasms.

89.

Now! Do it!

BETTY (CONT'D)

The table starts to buckle under the weight as THE HULK continues
to grow. Hulk is going to lift his head up and get seriously angry
any second... but then
BETTY LITERALLY JUMPS ONTO THE TABLE OVER HIM, leaning on that
massive torso, looking for his eyes.
BETTY (CONT'D)
BRUCE, STAY WITH ME!
Banner/Hulk howls.
BETTY (CONT'D)
Do it NOW!!!!
Sterns hits the button and THE ANTIDOTE starts to flow into him.
And slowly, painfully, THE PROCESS STARTS TO REVERSE. You can
almost see the fluid moving through those massive veins and
finding its way into every corner and calm the radiation fire in
his blood. AND HE SHRINKS...
Finally, Banner is back, lying on the buckled table with Betty
kneeling over him. She strokes his forehead. He’s drenched in
sweat, wrung out like a marathoner.
BETTY (CONT'D)
It’s alright. You’re alright. It’s over.

right behind. All heading into waiting UNMARKED VANS on 110th ST.
INT. STERNS’ LAB - NIGHT
They’re debriefing. Sterns talks a mile a minute.
STERNS
...the pulse came from the amygdala. I
think Dr. Ross’ ‘primer’ lets the cells
absorb the energy temporarily and then it
abates. That’s why you didn’t die of
radiation sickness years ago. Now maybe
we’ve neutralized those cells permanently
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
(MORE)

90.
STERNS (CONT'D)
I’m inclined to think the latter because
none of our test subjects had a decline
in absorption capacity, but of course
they were getting Gamma in MUCH lower
doses externally each time... But You!
It’s like you’ve got a turbo booster in
your brain. It’s one of the most
wonderful things I’ve ever seen!
BETTY
It’s not wonderful for Bruce.
STERNS
In a medical science sense, of course.
You’re miraculous.
BETTY
So how did you know it would work?
STERNS
I didn’t. But now that we have the data
on Bruce’s initial BANNER
Wait. You said ‘test subjects’. What test
subjects?

Banner is looking around in horror: his worst nightmare is coming
true before his eyes. He has been replicated.

course but as you can see we’re doing

Betty, following, ROSS PUTS A HAND ON HER ARM AND STOPS HER.
Betty...

ROSS

BETTY
I will never forgive what you have done
to him. And to me.
ROSS
He is a fugitive. He made choices and I
have a responsibility...
BETTY
You made him a fugitive! To cover your
failures and save your career. He told me
what you said to him after the accident,
before I woke up...what you proposed.
That’s why he ran and gave up...

95.

ROSS
His work...his blood...is the property of
the United States Army and my Duty
supersedes my personal feelings in this
matter.
BETTY
Truth Justice and the American Way...
ROSS
Something like that.
BETTY
You have to start with Truth or the rest
of it doesn’t work. Don’t speak to me as
your daughter. Not ever again.
She moves up the ramp...
ROSS
It’s only because you’re my daughter that
you’re not in handcuffs too.
INT. STERNS’ LAB - NIGHT
An ARMY RANGER SENTRY outside the doors.
CABOT QUESTIONING STERNS who sits in a chair.
CABOT
...then it’s not the same.
STERNS
Not exactly no, but it could be better.
What happened to him was a freak
accident. We’ve sorted out some of the
pieces but I don’t think I could put
together the same Humpty Dumpty just yet
if you follow me...
CABOT
I don’t want to know if you can make
another one I want to know if Banner’s
the only serious threat at the....
THUNK. CABOT JERKS A LITTLE, EYES ROLL BACK, AND SHE SLUMPS.
BLONSKY STANDS BEHIND HER IN SHADOW, HE HIT HER IN THE BACK OF THE
HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF HIS KNIFE.
STERNS
Jeez, what is it with you hitting people
all the ti---?
CLICK! BLONSKY’S PISTOL IS OUT AND COCKED IN STERNS’ FACE.

96.

STERNS (CONT’D)
What could I have possibly done to
deserve this?
BLONSKY
It’s not what you’ve done. It’s what
you’re going to do.
STERNS
Well I like your use of future tense in
that sentence anyway.
BLONSKY
I want what you got out of Banner.
STERNS
You’ve got it! Before you knocked the
Major out I told her I’ll help in any way
as long as I can...
BLONSKY
I want it in me.
STERNS
You look like you’ve got a little
something extra in you already, don’t
you.
BLONSKY
I want more. You saw what he becomes?
STERNS
I did. It’s beautiful...God-like. But I
can’t make you like that... I don’t know
what’s in you...the mix could be
something terrible.
BLONSKY BENDS AND GRABS STERNS BY THE FRONT OF HIS JACKET WITH ONE
HAND, LIFTING HIM EASILY, PLACING THE GUN UNDER HIS CHIN.
STERNS (CONT’D)
I’m not unwilling I just need ‘informed
consent’...and you’ve given it!

Stoller, Robertson and the Major...they
were all still up there!!
ROSS
Get our teams moving back there and get
PD Special Units out... Turn us around...
THE HELICOPTER BANKS SHARPLY
IN BACK: Banner and Betty can’t tell what’s going on, but they can
tell something has happened.
BANNER

SOLDIER 2
I’m going up...
He rises to dash to the lobby when
CRASH!! The sound of something huge crashing into a car out on
120th St, out of sight. And then they hear:
AN UNBELIEVABLE ROAR OF RAGE. They’re eyes on the narrow space
between the Lab Building and the one to its left...out toward the
street where
IN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS, AN ENORMOUS, HULKING GRAY FORM
SURGES PAST. AT LEAST 14 FEET TALL.
Soldiers and cops look at each other...”What the..?”
FOR THE STREET, and turn to the left in time to see

THEY DASH

THE MASSIVE GREY BACK OF THE THING DISAPPEARING TO THE RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER, UP BROADWAY.
COP 1

COP 1
Marines, 8 years. Let’s go.
The TWO SOLDIERS AND TWO COPS jump in and fire up. THEY PEEL OUT
TO THE RIGHT AND MAKE A QUICK LEFT UP AMSTERDAM.
INT. STERNS’ LAB - CONTINUOUS
FLAMES FLICKERING, SMOKE. A CANISTER FROM THE SATURATION MACHINE,
FULL OF BLOOD, DRIPPING DOWN ONTO...
STERNS ON THE FLOOR: EYES WIDE OPEN, AN EXPRESSION OF HORROR AND
AMAZEMENT ON HIS FACE, curiosity seems to have finally killed him.
Blood from the machine above drips on his face.
TIGHT ON: A RADIO CRACKLING: We can hear the SOLDIERS calling out
positions: “121st st moving north...what is that thing?”
REVEAL CABOT: knocked unconscious or dead?
EXT. AMSTERDAM AVE / INT. SIKORSKY - INTERCUT
THE HUMVEE: BLASTS up the street, hugging the left side, TWO COPS
in the front, TWO SOLDIERS standing up in the back with assault
rifles. SOLDIER 1 on the left keeping his view trained down the
cross streets whipping by...
POV: GLIMPSES OF THE CREATURE’S REAR FLANK AS IT MOVES UP THE
PARALLEL STREET. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES.
MONITORS: Ross seeing the same, it looks like Hulk but it’s not a
good enough look at it.
ROSS
Goddam it I said get me eyes on that
thing!

100.

BANNER moves toward Ross... the SOLDIER STOPS HIM
Sit down!

SOLDIER

BANNER
Shoot me...let’s see what happens.
BANNER SHOVES PAST HIM AND UP NEXT TO ROSS AT THE MONITORS, BETTY
FOLLOWS.
THE HUMVEE: reaches 125th St. The heart of Harlem. RIPPING THE
WHEEL TO THE LEFT, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. THEIR JAWS DROP...
Still from a distance, A MASSIVE GREY CREATURE IS CAUSING HAVOC.
Pedestrians flee in panic, cars skidding and trying to turn
around.
STREET COPS fire on the CREATURE -- IT RIPS A LIGHTPOLE OFF THE
CORNER AND SWATS THEM ASIDE LIKE MOSQUITOS
ROSS, BANNER AND BETTY: Agape at this horror
SOLDIER 1 (OVER RADIO)
Sir are you seeing this? What the hell is
that? Is that Banner?
ROSS
No. Is it Sterns?
INT. STERNS’ LAB - CONTINUOUS
A HAND GRABS A RADIO... CABOT
CABOT
General, it’s Blonsky. Sterns is dead...
It’s Blonsky.
EXT. 125TH STREET - NIGHT
TIGHTER ON THE CREATURE, first good look at it from the front.
14 FEET TALL, GRAY, AS HEAVILY MUSCLED AS HULK BUT WITH STRANGE
BONES PROTRUDING LIKE SPURS AT ITS ANKLES AND WRISTS
A HORRIBLE SNARLING FACE, AND IN IT WE CAN SEE THAT INDEED THIS IS
BLONSKY.
HE HAS BECOME: AN ABOMINATION
INT. SIKORSKY
BANNER: staring at the monitor. His worst fear come to life.

101.

ROSS
Hit it with whatever you’ve got, try to
draw it after you and get it to the
river. We’ve got cutters on both sides of
the island with sonic!
EXT. 125TH STREET
ABOMINATION IS HAVING A FIELD DAY, REVELLING IN DESTRUCTION.
SOLDIER 1 drops to the floor, prying open a large compartment.
SOLDIER 2
What are you doing?
SOLDIER 1
You think a rifle’s gonna hurt that?
Blonsky told me he put in some
ordinance...
HE COMES UP WITH A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
SOLDIER 1 (CONT’D)
That’s what I’m talking about, G!
He spins, flips the sight up, flips off the safety and throws it
on his shoulder
SOLDIER 1 (CONT’D)
Now say ‘good night, Gracie’...
FIRES. THE ABOMINATION TURNS AS THE RPG STREAKS DOWN THE STREET,
TRAILING SMOKE, STRAIGHT AT THE MONSTER’S HEAD...
SNATCH! LIKE A CAT THE ABOMINATION GRABS THE MISSILE STRAIGHT OUT
OF THE AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT THEM...AND SMASHES IT AGAINST HIS
OWN FOREHEAD WHERE IT EXPLODES
ABOMINATION LEERS AT THEM.
Time to go!

HE’S ENJOYING THIS.

SOLDIER 2

The cop at the wheel hits reverse and floors it, COP in front, and
BOTH SOLDIERS whip up their weapons and POUR FIRE IN ON
ABOMINATION, CHARGING STRAIGHT AT THEM, TAKING BULLETS LIKE HE’S
RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. HE CLOSES ON THEM, RAISING A MASSIVE
ARM...
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE HUMVEE SLAMS INTO A CAR COMING UP AMSTERDAM
ACROSS THE INTERSECTION AND THE ABOMINATION SEIZES IT BY THE HOOD,
HEAVES IT UP ,TWISTS IT SIDEWAYS AND SMASHES IT TO THE GROUND,
OVER AND OVER...METAL, HELMETS, BODIES FLYING.

102.

INT. TAXI CAB - COMING UP AMSTERDAM - CONTINUOUS
The same TERRIBLE CAB DRIVER that terrorized Bruce and Betty,
speeding up the avenue, he can see the light ahead is green but
traffic is slowed up ahead. Light goes yellow...
DRIVER
This is bullshit, people!!
He FLOORS IT, cuts to the side and races through the light turning
red straight into...
ABOMINATION -- WHO SIMPLY TURNS, HAMMERS HIS FOOT DOWN INTO THE
HOOD OF THE CHARGING CAB, JACKING IT STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR,
WHERE HE GRABS IT BY THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
MANGLED HUMVEE LIKE TWO PIECES OF BREAD BEING SMACKED TOGETHER.
HE ROARS, EXULTING IN HIS INVINCIBILITY, SCATTERING TERRIFIED
PEOPLE FROM THEIR CARS WHICH THEY ABANDON.
INT. SIKORSKY
MONITOR: FUZZED OUT.
BANNER, ROSS and BETTY: silent.
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
General, NYPD wants to know what to use
against it, SAC has that A-10 in the air
and ready... What do you want me to tell
them? .... Sir?
ROSS IS FROZEN: there is no way to fight this monster
BETTY
The sound waves stopped it at the
campus...they stopped Bruce...
ROSS
They need an open field of fire, there’s
too much down there to absorb them...too
many places to hide...
BANNER
You can’t stop it, you have to kill it.
ROSS
And what do you propose, a bomb? How big
should it be, you tell me!
BANNER
You have to take me back there.

103.

No...

BETTY

BANNER
It’s the only thing that can stop it. I’m
the only thing that can stop it.
ROSS
Forget it, if I put you down there you
won’t fight, you’ll run.
BANNER
We made that thing, you
got to try something! I
right, it’s still me. I
table calling to me and

and I!! We’ve
think you were
heard you on the
I held on...

BETTY
You think you can control it?
BANNER
No but maybe I can aim it.
ROSS
What if you just double my problem?
BANNER
Have you got a better idea?
ROSS
Put us near it. Get those cuffs off him.
BANNER
No... Open the door.

Do it!

Ross nods and the soldier hits the button and the huge REAR RAMP
of the helicopter starts to hinge open, COOL NIGHT AIR RUSHES IN.
Bruce moves toward the back, still in his wrist shackles.
BANNER (CONT’D)
Put me over it! Go higher!
They surge upward...climbing, the city dropping away.
Bruce looks out the open door of the Chinook, the city 3000 feet
below.
BETTY
Oh my god, no...what are you doing?! You
don’t even know if you’ll turn!
BANNER
I tried to do this a long time ago, when
I thought I’d killed you. It wouldn’t let
me.

104.

BETTY
This is too risky, it’s insane!
BANNER
I know, but I have to try. I’m sorry.
He takes a deep breath, kisses her

AND FALLS OUT THE DOOR.

EXT. NIGHT SKY OVER 125TH ST AND BROADWAY
TIGHT ON BANNER: as he falls, eyes squeezed tight, waiting...
EYES SNAP OPEN: Nothing. His face “Uh oh.”
And he falls away from us, becoming smaller and smaller, plunging
toward the street until we can barely see him and then...far
below... A small FLASH OF GREEN.
EXT. BROADWAY AND 125TH ST - CONTINUOUS
Looking up, something PLUNGES DOWN out of the dark, SPEEDING DOWN
THROUGH THE FRAME...there might have been a greenish glow as it...
CRASHES THROUGH THE STREET, leaving a very deep, rough hole.
LOOKING PAST THE HOLE, DOWN THE STREET: the figure of the
ABOMINATION wreaking havoc...CIVILIANS FLEEING...running towards
us.
REVERSE ON the hole as A MIGHTY GREEN HAND AND ARM RISE UP,
crushing the stone of the street to create a grip, muscles
flexing, hauling up a great weight...
TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from the Abomination, looking over their
shoulders, coming straight at us. One looks forward to see where
he’s going and STOPS IN HORROR at the sight of
THE HULK, pulling himself out of the hole. On his hands and knees,
Hulk looks up at the terrified guy and ROARS.
HULK POV SHOT: Over Hulk’s left shoulder we can see the guy
screaming even harder now, police lights flashing, people running.
A Police Chopper with it’s spotlight trained down on Abomination
in the distance...
...and as we SLIDE RIGHT PAST HULK’S MASSIVE HEAD... IT ALL TURNS
INTO HIS HALLUCINATORY MADNESS:
CAMERA CONTINUES TO ROLL AROUND HULK’S HEAD as we see all this,
landing back on his face where we see and really understand by now
the AGONY FOR BANNER OF BEING INSIDE HULK’S BRAIN...

105.

...but something new happens. HULK GRIMACES AT THE CHAOS OF IT
ALL, CLOSES HIS EYES AND STRAINS AND ROARS, SHAKING HIS HEAD AS IF
TO CLEAR IT...LOOKS UP...
...AND THINGS ARE MORE FOCUSED...THE SOUND CLARIFIES A LITTLE. Not
perfect...but better...and most importantly, he can see his
target: ABOMINATION.
Among the last of the fleeing people emptying the street, A HARLEM
LOUDMOUTH, hustling and protesting at the same time
LOUDMOUTH
...tired of this shit! Show me some
motherfuckin’ fifteen foot monster
buggin’ out in the WHITE man’s
neighborhood, somebody’d be...
He turns and sees HULK...stops cold...Looks back at Abomination...
LOUDMOUTH (CONT’D)
Oh, I see...it’s a family thing. I’m
gonna let you all work this out.
He scoots.
HULK STARES AT ABOMINATION’S BACK, STANDS TALL AND FLEXES AND
ROARS...and it SHAKES THE STREET.
ABOMINATION TURNS...SEES HIM. EYES FLARE...RECOGNITION.
INT. SIKORSKY - NIGHT
Ross and Betty looking down on the lanes of 125th St.
POV: the two TITANS START TO RUN AT EACH OTHER
EXT. 125TH STREET - NIGHT
HULK and ABOMINATION ACCELERATING TOWARD EACH OTHER.
AND THEY COLLIDE, LIKE TWO ELEPHANTS BEING SHOT TOGETHER
THE COLLISION EMITS A SOUND LIKE A THUNDERCLAP AND THE SHEER FORCE
OF IT BLOWS OUT THE GLASS AND LIGHTS OF THE MARQUEE ON THE APOLLO
THEATER AND SURROUNDING STOREFRONTS.
EXT. HARLEM STREETS - NIGHT
MANO A MANO: the TITANS brawl through the street, BEATING EACH
OTHER SAVAGELY.
ABOMINATION’S BONE PROTRUSIONS SLASH HULK’S
SKIN. HULK’S THUNDEROUS PUNCHES RATTLE OFF ABOMINATION STAGGERING
HIM BUT ALSO SHREDDING THE FLESH ON HULK’S KNUCKLES.

106.

ABOMINATION HAS HIM FROM BEHIND, A CHOKE HOLD. HULK DROPS A KNEE
AND LEVERS THE OPPOSITE SHOULDER, HEAVING ABOMINATION THROUGH THE
FRONT OF A CIRCUIT CITY SUPERSTORE...
INT. SUPERSTORE
ABOMINATION crashes headfirst through the glass doors and his head
goes straight into the stairs of an escalator, his shoulders
splitting the hand rails apart as TERRIFIED NIGHTTIME SHOPPERS
DIVE AWAY.
ABOMINATION pulls his head out of the NOW BROKEN ESCALATOR STAIR
BELT AND SEIZES IT BY A BROKEN END
EXT. STREET
ABOMINATION emerges from the store with THE SERRATED STEEL
ESCALATOR STAIR AS A FEARSOME WHIP
HE SLINGS IT AT HULK, SLICING LIGHTPOLES OFF AS IT ROLLS OUT AND
SLASHES HULK ACROSS HIS UPRAISED ARMS AND SHOULDERS.

POV: the silver whip arcing back through the air
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
WHIPPING AT HIM A SECOND TIME BUT HULK IS UNDER IT NOW, CATCHING
IT AS IT HISSES OVER, SPINNING HIS WEIGHT AGAINST IT AND FLINGING
ABOMINATION INTO A BRICK WALL, ONLY TO HAVE ABOMINATION SNAP IT
FROM UP TO DOWN SO THAT A NASTY WAVE ROLLS THROUGH IT CRACKING THE
END UP AND INTO HULK’S FACE, KNOCKING HIM ON HIS BACK. AND
ABOMINATION IS ON HIM AND BEATING HIM WITH HORRIBLE BLOWS...
CRABBING UP, HULK GETS HIS FEET UP UNDER HIM, ROLLS BACKWARD AND
FLIPS ABOMINATION UNDER HIM NOW, IMMEDIATELY RETURNING HORRIBLE
BLOWS INTO ABOMINATIONS RIBS THAT MAKE HIM HOWL IN PAIN. BUT NOW
IT’S ABOMINATION’S TURN TO GET HIS FEET INTO HULK’S TORSO AND HURL
HULK WITH THE FULL FORCE OF HIS LEGS A FULL BLOCK IN THE AIR AND
INTO THE 4TH FLOOR OF A 16 STORY APARTMENT BUILDING. HE ROLLS OVER
AND CHARGES THE BUILDING

107.

IN THE WINDOWS WE CAN LITERALLY SEE HULK FALLING DOWN THROUGH THE
CEILINGS OF TERRIFIED DWELLERS UNTIL HE HITS THE GROUND FLOOR
AGAIN
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
ABOMINATION BURSTS INTO A GROUND FLOOR APT, LOOKING FOR HULK
SEES HIM THROUGH THE SMALL DOORWAYS AND BARRELS IN. AS HULK RISES,
HE PUNCHES HIM WITH AN UPPERCUT THAT SENDS HIM BACK UP TWO FLOORS.
ABOMINATION HAULS HIMSELF UP IN PURSUIT, LOOKS LEFT TO GET KICKED
IN THE FACE, BLOWING HIM LATERALLY THROUGH THE WALL, PAST A FAMILY
WATCHING TV AND INTO THE NEXT APARTMENT AND OUT THE FAR WALL OF
THE BUILDING. THE BONES IN HIS ANKLES GRAB LIKE HOOKS AND PREVENT
HIM FROM FALLING AND HE DOES A SIT UP, SEES HULK CHARGING HIM,
GRABS THE OUTER WALL AND CLIMBS OUT OF THE WAY USING HIS HANDS TO
PULVERIZE HAND-HOLDS IN THE BRICK WALL .
HULK LOOKS OUT AND UP AND SCRAMBLES AFTER HIM, CRUSHING HIS OWN
HAND-HOLDS AND CLIMBING
INT. SIKORSKY
Looking down, they spot the monsters climbing onto the roof
They bank and circle
ROSS
They’re a block north of the university
again...can we get a local chopper with a
spot on it, maybe we can give him some
help.
EXT. 121ST STREET
CABOT, battered and shaken limps out onto the sidewalk the HUMVEE
departed and looks up at
THE SIKORSKY, arcing overhead, above a tall apartment building.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF - CONTINUOUS
A forest of water towers, huge industrial AC units.
HULK emerges over the lip of the roof, landing with a THUD
QUIET. No sign of Abomination. METAL GROANING. A WATER TOWER
SHAKES ON ITS IRON LEGS.

108.

Behind Hulk as he steps right to look around the stairwell...
nothing.
Back left...ABOMINATION. STANDING WITH A 20 FOOT IRON GIRDER IN
HIS HANDS LIKE A BASEBALL BAT.
SLIDING FROM HULK’S LEFT SHOULDER PAST HIS HEAD: HULK’S DISTORTION
VIEW: ABOMINATION SWINGS THE LETHAL CLUB
TOO FAST. IT CONNECTS -- A HORRIBLE SOUND. LIKE AN ALUMINUM BAT
AND IT CREAMS HULK BACK THROUGH THE AIR FULLY OVER THE ROOF OF THE
NEXT TWO BUILDINGS AND DOWN, DISAPPEARING WITH MUFFLED CRASH
SOMEWHERE 16 STORIES DOWN AND TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

STREAMS OF HIGH CALIBER FIRE STREAKING OUT THROUGH THE DARK
EXT. ROOFTOP
ROUNDS POUND INTO ABOMINATION, SOME GLANCING OFF THE PLATELIKE
BONES, OTHERS RIPPING THROUGH HIS FLESH PURPLISH BLOOD RISING IN
THE WOUNDS
HE TURNS, ENRAGED BY THIS NEW ATTACK AND HURLS HIS IRON GIRDER
LIKE A JAVELIN
IT ROCKETS AT THE HELICOPTER, MISSING BY A HAIR AND DISAPPEARING
OUT INTO THE DARK SKY
EXT. 5TH AVENUE - NEAR THE NORTH END OF CENTRAL PARK
An UPPER EAST SIDE MOM with her YOUNG SON and their DOG, walking
north, when
A 20 FOOT IRON GIRDER PLUNGES OUT OF THE SKY, CHOPPING ONE OF
THOSE RIDICULOUS HUMMER LIMOS IN HALF AND BOUNCING DOWN THE STREET
MOM
And that is why I tell you, “never go
above 96th Street!”
She turns them around.

109.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
HULK sprawled in a huge green DUMPSTER, shaking off stars.
He jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START DOWN THE ALLEY AND LEAPS...
HULK DOES A PARKOUR MOVE, USING HIS FEET TO RUN UP THE WALL BY
BOUNCING OFF EITHER SIDE OF THE CORNER.
EXT. ROOFTOPS
HULK pops out on the roof. Three blocks away he can see the
helicopter pouring fire down onto the roof at his foe.
ABOMINATION: taking hits, furious, reaches for A SATELLITE DISH.
HULK STARTS TO SPRINT
RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS, LEAPING GAPS IN BUILDINGS AND RISING
TO HIGHER ROOFS, USING BOTH HANDS AND FEET TO ACCELERATE HIMSELF
PARKOUR-STYLE HE CHARGES
ABOMINATION: RIPS THE SATELLITE DISH FROM ITS BASE AND LOOKS UP AS
THE HELICOPTER ARCS ROUND TO FIND HIM, HE TWISTS HIS BODY LIKE
GREEK DISCUS THROWER
HULK: CLOSING... HE ACCELERATES IN A FINAL BURST AND DIVES,
HITTING ABOMINATION JUST AS HE THROWS
- THE SATELLITE DISH, WOBBLED OFF ITS COURSE BY HULK’S HIT, CLIPS
THE TAIL ROTOR OF THE SIKORSKY
- HULK HITS ABOMINATION SO HARD THAT IT SEEMS TO SNAP HIM ALMOST
IN HALF
- THE HELICOPTER STARTS ARCING DOWN OUT OF CONTROL
PILOT’S VOICE
I can’t hold it! I gotta put it down!
Hang on!!
- BETTY CLOSES HER EYES
- HULK AND ABOMINATION FLY ON THEIR OWN PARALLEL ARC, BARELY
MISSING THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PLUNGING SIKORSKY
- CABOT’S POV FROM THE STREET: THE TWIN FORMS OF THE MONSTERS AND
THE CRASHING HELICOPTER DESCENDING IN A RUSH OF SOUND
- HULK AND ABOMINATION PLUNGE OVER THE ROOF OF A UNIVERSITY
BUILDING, POUNDING THROUGH THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE OF A HUGE WATERTOWER ON THE WAY DOWN

110.

- THE WATER TOWER TOPPLES
- THE HELICOPTER SPINNING WILDLY AROUND ITS MAIN ROTOR BARELY
CLEARS A BUILDING, CLIPS THE SIDE OF A LARGE UNIVERSITY HALL AND
CRASHES INTO THE CORNER OF A LARGE STONE PLAZA, SURROUNDED BY
UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS
- HULK AND ABOMINATION CRASH INTO THE SAME PLAZA, PULVERIZING THE
STONE AND GOUGING A 100 FOOT LONG GROOVE
- THE WATER TOWER CRASHES, HITS THE EDGE OF THE BUILDING, SNAPS
THE TANK ITSELF OFF, WHICH PLUMMETS TO THE GROUND AND BURSTS,
SENDING THOUSANDS OF GALLONS WASHING OVER HULK AND ABOMINATION AND
SEPARATING THEM SLIGHTLY.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY PLAZA - CONTINUOUS
People in windows and surging into the perimeter to watch. People
are starting to CHEER FOR HULK.
BUT ABOMINATION BEATS HULK AGAINST A WALL LIKE A BOXER
CLINCHES AND STARTS TO CHOKE HULK WITH HIS MASSIVE FOREARM PINNING
HIS THROAT AGAINST THE STONE WALL, CRACKING IT; HIS WRIST BONE
DIGGING INTO HULK’S NECK.
THE SHATTERED HELICOPTER: Lying on its side; the rear end and ramp
are crushed closed. There is no side door. In the cockpit glass
the pilot looks dead; in the gunner’s opening on the side, the
GUNNER slumped unconscious, the CANNON bent blocking the escape of
BETTY: trying to find a way out
SPARKS BURST IN CASCADES from the shattered Rotors assembly,
flying closer and closer to the HUGE SIDE GAS TANKS, torn open and
dripping POOLS OF GAS right below Betty.
BETTY looks down into the cabin at:
Go...GO!!

ROSS, battered

ROSS

BETTY can only get halfway out...she sees the flames...
BRUCE!!

BETTY

HULK SEES BETTY TRAPPED IN THE HELICOPTER, SHE’s IN TROUBLE
GREEN PULSE: IN THE BASE OF HULK’S SKULL AND NEW SIZE AND STRENGTH
LITERALLY SURGE INTO HIM IN FRONT OF OUR EYES
ABOMINATION’S EYES GO WIDE AS HULK SEIZES HIS WRISTS AND WITH RAW
POWER SPREADS ABOMINATION’S HANDS AWAY FROM HIS THROAT

111.

HULK HEAD-BUTTS AGAIN AND AGAIN, THEN DELIVERS A MASSIVE BLOW TO
THE SOLAR PLEXUS, DOUBLING ABOMINATION WHO HE THEN DRIVES
HEADFIRST INTO THE WALL
HULK SPRINTS FOR BETTY AS THE SPARK HITS THE TANK WITH A WHOOSH OF
FLAME
HULK ISN’T GOING TO BEAT AN EXPLOSION AND HE SUCKS IN A HUGE
BREATH AND BLOWS A TREMENDOUS BLAST OF BREATH AT THE FLAME FROM 15
FEET AWAY, BLOWING IT OUT.
Wow.

BETTY (CONT’D)

A CRACKING, RATTLING SOUND....Her eyes go wide.
And HULK takes A TREMENDOUS BLOW TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD,
STAGGERING HIM. HE SPINS...
ABOMINATION HAS MADE A CLUB OUT OF A CHAIN RUNNING BETWEEN
CONCRETE POSTS, WITH THE POSTS STILL ATTACHED LIKE A MACE
BEFORE HULK CAN RECOVER FROM THE BLOW, HE SWINGS AGAIN; THIS TIME
HULK DUCKS BUT IT CATCHES HIM IN THE THIGH AND KNEE, WIPING HIS
LEGS OUT... A HORRIBLE BONE-CRUNCHING BLOW.
HULK TRIES TO RISE, BATTERED...ON ONE KNEE
BETTY: helping Ross out of the crushed cabin turns to see...
ABOMINATION WINDS UP FOR THE FINAL BLOW
HULK, INTO A SQUAT, RAISES HIS FISTS HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND
DRIVES THEM INTO THE GROUND, THE CONCUSSION SO POWERFUL THAT A
CRACK EXPLODES VIOLENTLY UP ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE PLAZA
SO THAT AS ABOMINATION STEPS TO SWING, HE IS KNOCKED OFF BALANCE,
HIS FOOT COMING DOWN IN THE FISSURE
AND AS THE CLUB ARCS OVER HULK’S HEAD, MISSING, HE GRABS THE
CHAIN, DIVES AND ROLLS FORWARD PAST ABOMINATION, WRAPPING THE
CHAIN AROUND HIS ENEMY’S NECK ONCE, TWICE... AND HEAVES BACK ON
IT.
ABOMINATION’S LEG IS CAUGHT IN THE FISSURE, HULK TWISTING HIM
AGAINST THE TRAPPED LEG TO TRAP HIM. DESPITE THE HORRENDOUS TORQUE
ON HIS BODY, IT ALMOST SEEMS AS THOUGH ABOMINATION HAS THE BRUTE
STRENGTH IN HIS NECK AND BACK TO RESIST...
...THE EYES OF ALL ONLOOKERS GLUED TO THE DEATH MATCH
ABOMINATION’S HAND GRABS BEHIND HIM TEARING AT HULK’S FACE AND
SHOULDERS, CUTTING FLESH, GOUGING HULK’S EYES

112.

HULK DOESN’T FLINCH. HEAVING BACK WITH EVERY FIBRE OF HIS
STRENGTH HE LIFTS ONE FOOT AND PLANTS IT INTO ABOMINATION’S
SHOULDER...THIS IS THE LETHAL LEVERAGE HE NEEDED.
HE PRESSES OUT WITH HIS LEG, REARING BACK AND UP ON THE CHAIN WITH
HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS...BOTH CREATURES HOWL, EVERY VEIN BURSTING.
AND THEN WITH A HORRIBLE POPPING AND CRACKING...HULK BREAKS THE
ABOMINATION’S NECK, LITERALLY STRETCHING AND TWISTING IT
GROTESQUELY
ABOMINATION’S EYES FLARE...AND THEN WITH A FINAL KICK...HE SAGS.
HULK FALLS BACK, SITTING, HIS FOOT STILL ON THE SHOULDER. HE
RISES, SHOVING THE BODY OVER ONTO ITS FACE,
AND WITH ONE FOOT PLANTED ON THE HUGE BACK OF HIS ENEMY AND THE
MOON SHINING DOWN ON HIM, HE THROWS BACK HIS FISTS AND ROARS
FACES:

ROSS, BETTY, CABOT, onlookers... STARING IN AWE

HULK SCANS THE RING -- looking for any new threat, face fierce.
DARK GREEN BLOOD RUNS IN THICK RIVULETS FROM TEARS ALL OVER HIS
BODY... HIS NOSE...HIS GAZE FINDS...
Betty.

He stops and stares at her. Knows her.

Behind her: Ross - he knows him too and his EYES FLARE, but Ross
only stares.
BETTY (CONT’D)
Shh. It’s over... it’s over.
Betty.

HULK

It’s a deep bass rumble, barely a whisper.
A tear falls down her cheek and he puts out a finger to catch it.
Tired.

Eyes almost drooping...

THE BEATING OF ROTORS AND A WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT sweeping on him.
SLIDING INTO HULK’S POV: THE LIGHT IS HORRIBLE, an ASSAULT
Betty’s head drops... she knows...
AND HULK RUNS...
Straight at a limping CABOT, standing between him and the
street...

CABOT
You gotta be kidding me...
She DUCKS as he HURDLES OVER HER.
EXT. STREETS OF HARLEM - RIVERSIDE PARK - CONTINUOUS
Hulk sprints west, crosstown… Pounding the pavement…cars
screeching to a halt…people gaping as the Titan flashes past….
…accelerating…out of the buildings and through the trees at the
top end of Riverside Park… Helicopters above tracking him… sound
of radio calls trying to keep tabs on him… warning the Coast Guard
ship that he’s heading their way…
…and he can see it … the water of the Hudson River…
A COAST GUARD CUTTER on the near shore blocking his path…
The spotlight from the POLICE CHOPPER on him now… the Coast Guard
cutter swinging it’s own light up to find him as he races toward
it, reaches the elevated spans of the West Side Highway…
…and LEAPS...HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET...SOARING HIGH…
Sailor’s POV: THE HULK HURTLING THROUGH THE BLACK SKY, LIT BY
SPOTLIGHTS, COMING RIGHT AT HIM...FEET EXTENDED, ARMS OUT
WIDE...HE SMASHES THROUGH THE RADAR DISH...
AND JACKKNIFES INTO THE WATER LIKE A DEPTH CHARGE.
EXT. UNDERWATER
In the inky green black of the river…
THE HULK SMASHES INTO FRAME FROM ABOVE
He rockets through the frame…trailing greenish white bubbles…
…AND DISAPPEARS… as the bubbles fade… TO BLACK.
FADE UP:
INT. MILITARY BASE BAR - DAY
Ross sits on a bar stool in the middle of a mostly empty bar, midafternoon. He lifts his drink to his lips, catches his reflection
in a mirror behind the bar.

114.

EXT. BETTY AND SAMSON’S HOUSE - DAY
Samson sits on the front steps, staring out at the street. He
lifts the cordless phone in his hand and dials a number.
EXT. BATTERY PARK- CONTINUOUS
Betty stands by a railing overlooking the river and the New York
Harbor. A FERRY tugs out towards the Statue of Liberty. Her phone
rings, she pulls it out and looks at the number, answers.
BETTY

Hi.

SAMSON
Oh, thank god. You’re alright? When I
couldn’t reach you...
BETTY
I’m not hurt. A lot of people were
though.
SAMSON
I know, it’s been all over the tv. It
doesn’t seem real.
It was real.
Come home.

BETTY

SAMSON
Just come home.

BETTY
Samson, did you call somebody the night
Bruce was at our home? Is that why they
came for him?
SAMSON
I was frightened. Forgive me.
BETTY
I do. But I’m not coming home yet.
SAMSON
Where are you going?
BETTY
I have no idea. But I’ll let you know
when I do. I promise.
She hangs up.
He buries his face in his hands.

115.

Betty takes out her camera and looks at the PICTURE SHE TOOK OF
BRUCE...THAT SAD, HOPEFUL SMILE.
She looks out at the harbor and tries to imagine where he is...
EXT/INT - REMOTE EXOTIC LOCATION - DAY
A BEACH: Banner staring out at the ocean.
ROUGH BUNGALOW.

He steps into A SMALL

He walks to a tidy desk and takes out an envelope from the drawer.
He has something in his hand... it’s Betty’s mother’s necklace. He
slides it into the envelope and writes her name on it.
TIME CUT:
We’re behind his head now...rolling around him to find him sitting
in the lotus position...meditating. Black pants. No shirt. His
eyes closed. Pulse monitor on his wrist. Faces the open doors
opened out towards the ocean waves.
He hardly seems to breathe. PULSE: 42.
Then, with a deep inhale...his PULSE STARTS TO RISE...
Nothing has changed around him, but his pulse is RACING
UPWARD...the sound of his heart BEATING FAST
RACING OVER 200
EYES SNAP OPEN: GREEN
WAS THAT A FLASH OF A SMILE?
BLACK
END.
