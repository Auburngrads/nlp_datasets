MAN:
BOY:
MAN:
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...

Page 2/62

the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY:
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID:
BOY:
You ain't got nothing.
MAN:
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

Page 3/62

We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES:
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.

Page 4/62

He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack

Page 5/62

at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE:
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1:
MILITANT 2:
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.

MILITANT 1:
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA:
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER:
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1:
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER:
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you

Page 7/62

to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN:
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL

OKOYE:
My Prince...
we are home.
This never gets old.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL
PLAYING)
Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA:
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off

Page 8/62

before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI:
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

Page 9/62

16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

Page 10/62

GUARD:
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1:
some space, please.
MEDIC 2:
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds

Page 11/62

with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

M'Baku, what are you

It's challenge day.
We have watched...
and listened
from the mountains!
We have watched
with disgust...
as your
technological advancements
have been overseen by a child!
Who scoffs at tradition!
And now you want to
hand the nation
over to this prince...
who could not keep
his own father safe.
Mmm?
We will not have it.
I said,
we will not have it, oh!
I, M'Baku...

I accept your challenge,

Father.
My son.
T'CHAKA:
You are a king.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)

Page 15/62

What is wrong my son?
I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)
Breathe.
T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Breathe.
He was there.
(CHUCKLES)
He was there. My father.
(BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO
PLAYING)
Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you

Page 16/62

and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.
(SIGHS)
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA:
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI:
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?

Page 17/62

Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed

Page 18/62

when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI:
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with

Page 19/62

audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA:
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA:
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA:
SHURI:
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting

Page 20/62

at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI:
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI:
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)
You're recording?
For research purposes.
(SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
Delete that footage.

It looks nice.

What? It's a disgrace.
(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets.
They're good.
Good for trouble...
...like you?
(EXCLAIMS)
Thank you!
(PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND
AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING)
Spread out.
The buyer
is likely already here.
The woman outside.
What trouble
was she referring to?
Ah... I got into
a disagreement
with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?
Depends...
on how quickly we finish
the mission.
OKOYE:
Can we please focus?
Thank you.

One whiskey, please.
Eyes up. Americans.
I count three.
OKOYE:
How could you miss
Greased Lightning
there behind you?
Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER:
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here

Page 23/62

- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS:
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.

And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE:
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me

listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.
(CHUCKLES)
You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE:
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA:
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.

Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.

(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

Page 29/62

ROSS:
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE:
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.

Page 30/62

They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?

Something is happening

This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE:
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE:
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?

Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.

KILLMONGER:
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA:
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.

Page 34/62

Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI:
on me.
- No!

Page 35/62

- (GRUNTING)
ZURI:
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI:
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS:
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

Page 36/62

Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS:
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him

Page 37/62

a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS:
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI:
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium

Page 38/62

and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands

KILLMONGER:
RAMONDA:
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't

- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,

Son of N'Jobu?

You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:

(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right

Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!

Page 40/62

The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.

will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,

Iraq.
I took life from

(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.

He's a friend of T'Challa's.

Yes. The sunsets there

But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.

is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.

Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time

we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead

Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?

Page 45/62

Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know

We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE:
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.

It's beautiful.

Maybe we can still heal you.
Why?
So you can just lock me up?
Nah.
Just bury me in the ocean...

'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

you would take me

I thought
you meant Coachella...

Why here?
This is where our father
killed our uncle.
They're tearing it down.
Good.
They are not tearing it down.
I bought this building.
And that building.
And that one over there.
This will be the first
Wakandan International

Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.
And you will spearhead
the science

My name is King T'Challa...
son of King T'Chaka.
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.
And for the first time

Page 60/62

in our history...
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...
with the outside world.
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...
what can a nation of farmers
have to offer
the rest of the world?
